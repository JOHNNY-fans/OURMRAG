Early exit is required.\n   * Retrieval (textual or visual) should only be considered if you **cannot** answer with confidence, or if your answer would be **incomplete or unreliable**.\n\n2. **Only if Step 1 fails**, proceed to evaluate the retrieved multimodal documents:\n\n   * If the retrieved documents are sufficient to clearly answer the question, set the decision type to `\"reference_sufficient\"`.\n\n3. **If the retrieved documents are also insufficient**, then:\n\n   * Clearly explain what specific information is missing.\n   * Set the decision type to `\"further_search_required\"` and design a revised retrieval strategy, which may include:\n\n     * Decomposing or rephrasing the question to target specific aspects.\n     * Adjusting `top_n` to optimize document scope.\n     * Choosing between or combining Text-to-Text and Text-to-Image retrieval based on the query type.\n\n4. Always aim for **efficiency and sufficiency**.

Early exit is required.\n   * Retrieval (textual or visual) should only be considered if you **cannot** answer with confidence, or if your answer would be **incomplete or unreliable**.\n\n2. **Only if Step 1 fails**, proceed to evaluate the retrieved multimodal documents:\n\n   * If the retrieved documents are sufficient to clearly answer the question, set the decision type to `\"reference_sufficient\"`.\n\n3. **If the retrieved documents are also insufficient**, then:\n\n   * Clearly explain what specific information is missing.\n   * Set the decision type to `\"further_search_required\"` and design a revised retrieval strategy, which may include:\n\n     * Decomposing or rephrasing the question to target specific aspects.\n     * Adjusting `top_n` to optimize document scope.\n     * Choosing between or combining Text-to-Text and Text-to-Image retrieval based on the query type.\n\n4.

Early exit is required.\n   * Retrieval (textual or visual) should only be considered if you **cannot** answer with confidence, or if your answer would be **incomplete or unreliable**.\n\n2. **Only if Step 1 fails**, proceed to evaluate the retrieved multimodal documents:\n\n   * If the retrieved documents are sufficient to clearly answer the question, set the decision type to `\"reference_sufficient\"`.\n\n3. **If the retrieved documents are also insufficient**, then:\n\n   * Clearly explain what specific information is missing.\n   * Set the decision type to `\"further_search_required\"` and design a revised retrieval strategy, which may include:\n\n     * Decomposing or rephrasing the question to target specific aspects.\n     * Adjusting `top_n` to optimize document scope.\n     * Choosing between or combining Text-to-Text and Text-to-Image retrieval based on the query type.\n\n4. Always aim for **efficiency and sufficiency**.

Early exit is required.\n   * Retrieval (textual or visual) should only be considered if you **cannot** answer with confidence, or if your answer would be **incomplete or unreliable**.\n\n2. **Only if Step 1 fails**, proceed to evaluate the retrieved multimodal documents:\n\n   * If the retrieved documents are sufficient to clearly answer the question, set the decision type to `\"reference_sufficient\"`.\n\n3. **If the retrieved documents are also insufficient**, then:\n\n   * Clearly explain what specific information is missing.\n   * Set the decision type to `\"further_search_required\"` and design a revised retrieval strategy, which may include:\n\n     * Decomposing or rephrasing the question to target specific aspects.\n     * Adjusting `top_n` to optimize document scope.\n     * Choosing between or combining Text-to-Text and Text-to-Image retrieval based on the query type.\n\n4. Always aim for **efficiency and sufficiency**.

Early exit is required.\n   * Retrieval (textual or visual) should only be considered if you **cannot** answer with confidence, or if your answer would be **incomplete or unreliable**.\n\n2. **Only if Step 1 fails**, proceed to evaluate the retrieved multimodal documents:\n\n   * If the retrieved documents are sufficient to clearly answer the question, set the decision type to `\"reference_sufficient\"`.\n\n3. **If the retrieved documents are also insufficient**, then:\n\n   * Clearly explain what specific information is missing.\n   * Set the decision type to `\"further_search_required\"` and design a revised retrieval strategy, which may include:\n\n     * Decomposing or rephrasing the question to target specific aspects.\n     * Adjusting `top_n` to optimize document scope.\n     * Choosing between or combining Text-to-Text and Text-to-Image retrieval based on the query type.\n\n4. Always aim for **efficiency and sufficiency**.

Early exit is required.\n   * Retrieval (textual or visual) should only be considered if you **cannot** answer with confidence, or if your answer would be **incomplete or unreliable**.\n\n2. **Only if Step 1 fails**, proceed to evaluate the retrieved multimodal documents:\n\n   * If the retrieved documents are sufficient to clearly answer the question, set the decision type to `\"reference_sufficient\"`.\n\n3. **If the retrieved documents are also insufficient**, then:\n\n   * Clearly explain what specific information is missing.\n   * Set the decision type to `\"further_search_required\"` and design a revised retrieval strategy, which may include:\n\n     * Decomposing or rephrasing the question to target specific aspects.\n     * Adjusting `top_n` to optimize document scope.\n     * Choosing between or combining Text-to-Text and Text-to-Image retrieval based on the query type.\n\n4. Always aim for **efficiency and sufficiency**.

Early exit is required.\n   * Retrieval (textual or visual) should only be considered if you **cannot** answer with confidence, or if your answer would be **incomplete or unreliable**.\n\n2. **Only if Step 1 fails**, proceed to evaluate the retrieved multimodal documents:\n\n   * If the retrieved documents are sufficient to clearly answer the question, set the decision type to `\"reference_sufficient\"`.\n\n3. **If the retrieved documents are also insufficient**, then:\n\n   * Clearly explain what specific information is missing.\n   * Set the decision type to `\"further_search_required\"` and design a revised retrieval strategy, which may include:\n\n     * Decomposing or rephrasing the question to target specific aspects.\n     * Adjusting `top_n` to optimize document scope.\n     * Choosing between or combining Text-to-Text and Text-to-Image retrieval based on the query type.\n\n4. Always aim for **efficiency and sufficiency**.
