The route begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Skaneateles and heads northeast for most of its length. Route 41 does not intersect with another state-maintained highway, but does follow the former alignment of two. The highway ends at an intersection with CR 83 (South Street) and CR 150 (Platt Road).

In many countries, the public sector is responsible for the infrastructure required to support urban development. This infrastructure may include road infrastructure, parks, social, health and educational facilities, social housing, climate adaptation and mitigation tools, and more. Such infrastructure typically requires great financial investment and maintenance, and often the financing of such projects leans heavily on the government bodies themselves. Public entities, tasked with creating and maintaining this infrastructure, are constantly in search of mechanisms which can allow for fiscal support of these investments. One such mechanism of financing is Value Capture. Value capture schemes secure and recover a portion of the benefits delivered by public investments, in order to offset the costs of the investment itself. Value Capture strategies operate under the assumption that public investment often results in increased valuation of private land and real estate. \"Capturing\u201d the subsequent increase in value, governments are able to recuperate funds, which can ultimately be used to generate additional value for communities in the future. Public investments, such as building transportation or sewer facilities, can increase adjacent land values, generating an unearned profit for private landowners.The unearned value (increases in land value which otherwise profit private landowners cost-free) may be \"captured\" directly by converting them into public revenue (see georgism). Thus, value capture internalizes the positive externalities of public investments, allowing public agencies to tax the direct beneficiaries of their investments. Urban planners and finance officials are often interested in value capture mechanisms, for at least two reasons: 1) because they offer a targeted method to finance infrastructure benefiting specific land, and 2) because some such investments can generate private investment in the area, which will more widely benefit the city (e.g., by providing employment opportunities, shopping and other amenities, and a more robust and diverse tax base.) It can be politically useful to capture for the city treasury a share of the positive externalities of city-financed investment. This can help address public concern about the fact or perception of unfair windfalls when specific owners\u2019 land values increase after urban infrastructure investment is paid from general city revenues. Although it is not always talked about as such, the most common value capture mechanism is the general real property tax, with no special features other than regular assessment of market value; this is because the common real estate tax includes the less known land value tax. The value of any given land is determined by its proximity to various amenities (both public and private). Thus, for example, when a new subway station or highway interchange is installed, land near the new facility becomes more valuable. Investment in capital improvements to land can synergistically generate capital investment in other nearby locations, which further increases land value. Thus, even if the rate of taxation does not change, the tax revenue generated from properties which benefit goes up by way of higher land values and increased development.The effectiveness of value capture depends, of course, on a smoothly functioning ad valorem property or land value tax system, with regularly updated assessments.<PIC> Value capture strategies can be applied to developers or landowners, and they can be applied before or after a public improvement is built. In the case of new public transit facilities, the property value premium nearby can be as high as 167%. Types of value capture include the following: Land value tax (LVT) Tax-increment financing (TIF) Special assessment districts or improvement districts Infrastructure impact fees (such as traffic or utility fees) Joint development Air rights Exactions, public easements, or other nonpossessory interests", "images": ["w_s61"], "tokens": 836}]}

They are waterproof and have a plastic feel, rather than the soft.Today, plastic pants are usually made out of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyurethane (PU). Latex rubber is sometimes used, however it has significant drawbacks in these applications: it is easily damaged by rough handling, oils, creams, and ointments; it does not allow air to ventilate; it also makes a characteristic rustling noise when moved, which limits its use in situations where discretion is necessary. The availability of inexpensive, and easily worked, man-made waterproof materials since the 1950s has significantly improved the quality of life of those with continence problems, and has contributed to changes in clothing style and freedom, especially for infants and menstruating women.<PIC> At the turn of the 20th century, oiled silk was used as a waterproofing medium in adult clothing, but not until latex rubber was commercially available in the 1920s did the idea of wearing a protective garment become commonplace. Ladies' panties were worn with a waterproof latex crotch insert or a waterproof panel in the back of an underskirt, to make coping with heavy menstruation cycles easier and socially safer. The original diaper covers were made from oiled wool, which was naturally waterproof. Newly available latex pants for covering diapers reduced the difficulties in caring for young children on long journeys, on special social occasions, and overnight. During the 1950s, plastics, mainly PVC, replaced latex on account of their lower cost, ease of maintenance, and lack of noise when handled. However, the history of these garments has influenced their modern names: \u201cRubber pants\u201d and \u201cRubbers\u201d are used commonly to mean waterproof pants of all kinds, even though they are typically now made of plastic rather than latex. The invention of superabsorbent polymers (for diapers and incontinence pads), and blood-gelling polymers (for sanitary pads) largely displaced traditional cloth diapers and pads. Not only were these modern absorbent materials lighter and less bulky, but they became available as an \u201call-in-one\u201d solution with their own integral waterproof plastic backing. This eliminated the need for separate waterproof underwear in many situations. Nevertheless, waterproof pants are still used as a second line of defense where absolute protection from leakage is crucial. The development of plastic pants contributed significantly to juvenile fashion. Until the late 1950s, infants of both sexes usually wore short dresses until they were ready for toilet training thus avoiding the risks to clothing and hygiene of having top clothes in prolonged close contact with a damp or soiled diaper. Effective and easily obtainable waterproofing \u2013 whether integral with the pad or as separate pants \u2013 safely allowed a child to be dressed in trousers. The development of disposable diapers made the fit of clothing even neater as the new diapers were less bulky than the cloth ones.", "images": ["w_s81"], "tokens": 774}]}

Based on its original design, NOR flash memory is designed to store binary code of programs because it supports XIP (eXecute-In-Place) and high performance in read operations, while NAND flash memory is used as a data storage because of its lower price and higher performance in write/erase operations, compared to NOR flash. In recent years, the price of NAND flash has gone down much faster than that of NOR flash. Thus, to reduce the hardware cost ultimately, using NAND flash to replace NOR flash (motivated by a strong market demand) becomes a new trend in embedded-system designs, especially on mobile phones and arcade games. The replacement depends on well-designed management of flash memory, which is carried out by either software on a host system (as a raw medium) or hardware circuits/firmware inside its devices. Here, an efficient prediction mechanism with limited memory-space requirements and an efficient implementation is proposed. The prediction mechanism collects the access patterns of program execution to construct a prediction graph by adopting the working set concept.According to the prediction graph, the prediction mechanism prefetches data (/code) to the SRAM cache, so as to reduce the cache miss rate. Therefore, the performance of the program execution is improved and the read performance gap between NAND and NOR is filled up effectively. Using NAND Flash for boot code requires the use of DRAM to shadow the code.<PIC> Different from the popular caching ideas in the memory hierarchy, this approach aims at an application-oriented caching mechanism, which adopts prediction-assisted prefetching based on given execution traces of applications. The designs of embedded systems are considered with a limited set of applications, such as ueued, on the other hand. The prefetch procedure is done in a greedy way: Let P1 be the last prefetched page. If P1 corresponds to a regular node, then the page that corresponds to the subsequent LBA is prefetched. If P1 corresponds to a branch node, then the procedure should prefetch pages by following all possible next LBA links in an equal base and a round-robin way. As of 2021, 2D NAND replacement by 3D NAND has commenced. 3D NAND has the advantages of lower cost per bit and the latest controller technology for better reliability. Consequently, even at the low GB level, 3D NAND is the preferred option for code storage.", "images": ["w_s84"], "tokens": 617}]}

Johnson previously played for Aston Villa and had brief loan spells at Yeovil Town, Chesterfield and Oldham Athletic. Born in Jamaica, Johnson played for Crystal Palace as a schoolboy before moving on to Aston Villa's academy. Johnson's potential was recognised following the 2010\u201311 season. Extra responsibility was placed on Johnson when academy coach Tony McAndrew handed him the captain's armband. As well as leading Villa to the Barclays Premier Academy League Group B title, he was an inspiration during the FA Youth Cup campaign. A left-foot strike from the edge of the box in round four against Peterborough United crowned a true captain's performance and ignited a cup run that would see the young lions reach the semi-finals. His performances for the academy and reserve teams had already caught the eye of manager at the time Gerard Houllier. The Frenchman called up Johnson to Aston Villa's first team for the first time, where he was an unused substitute in Villa's 2\u20131 League Cup win over Burnley. In January 2011, the midfielder signed his first professional contract at Villa Park.Johnson had another season of great progress in 2011\u201312, featuring in all but one of the title-winning reserve team's fixtures as well as making the first team bench for six Premier League games. In the reserve ranks, Johnson once again demonstrated his ability to supply goals from the central ground. He found the net five times, including a wonder strike in a 3\u20131 defeat against a Manchester United side featuring the likes of Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Tom Cleverley. That scoring knack was also replicated on the European stage during Villa's run to the quarter-finals of the NextGen Series. Johnson was the only player to feature in all seven of the club's NextGen games and he managed three goals in the process. Those strikes came in home and away wins against Fenerbah\u00e7e and in a 3\u20132 defeat by Rosenborg. In March 2012, he extended his contract to summer 2013 but he has still yet to make his official debut for Villa. On 13 June 2013, Johnson signed a new two-year deal keeping him at the club until 2015. Johnson made a series of short loan moves to League One sides over three seasons. On 23 October 2012, Johnson joined Football League One side Yeovil Town on a month-long youth loan deal, and made his Football League debut as a substitute that evening in Yeovil's 3\u20131 victory over Shrewsbury Town. Johnson joined Chesterfield on a three-month loan in August 2014 and made his debut in a 2\u20131 away win over Port Vale on 30 August. Johnson played 13 times for Chesterfield, becoming a first team regular. On 10 November 2014, Johnson joined another League One side, Oldham, on a two-month deal until 5 January 2015. On 23 January 2015, Johnson joined Preston North End for an undisclosed fee, believed to be \u00a350,000, on a two-and-a-half year contract.

The couple married thirteen months after the Aga Khan III and his third wife were divorced by mutual consent. The Begum was well known for her generosity towards and compassion for the impoverished and the elderly. Her Egyptian Om Habibeh Foundation worked towards the alleviation of poverty and the improvement of quality of life in the area surrounding Aswan, Egypt, and in Le Cannet she established a retirement home. She was particularly interested in women's issues and, an accomplished artist and sculptor, she was also interested in the arts including classical music, ballet, and the opera. The Begum died at the age of 94 in Le Cannet and was buried in the mausoleum of her husband at Aswan. She was born Yvonne Blanche Labrousse in the town of S\u00e8te, France on 15 February 1906. She was called Yvette. She was the daughter of Adrien Labrousse, a tramway conductor, and Marie Brouet, a seamstress. Her family soon moved to Cannes and later on to Lyon where the young Yvette spent most of her childhood. In 1929, at the age of twenty-four, she became Miss Lyon and one year later she was named Miss France.As a beauty queen and a representative of France, she traveled to many countries around the world. She found herself particularly taken by Egypt and, in the late 1930s, she moved to Cairo and adopted the faith of Islam. Yvette Labrousse met Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III in Egypt and they married on 9 October 1944 in Switzerland. The new Begum assumed the name of Om Habibeh after one of the Prophet Muhammad's wives. Her husband playfully nicknamed her \"Yaky\", which was composed from the initials of \"Yvette\", \"Aga\" and \"Khan\". The Begum designed their villa at Le Cannet near Cannes and it was named \"Yakymour\", combining her nickname \"Yaky\" and \"Amour\", the French word for love. In 1954, Om Habibeh was given the title of Mata Salamat, which literally means serene or peaceful mother. Of his marriage to Begum Om Habibeh, the Aga Khan III wrote in his memoirs, \"I can only say that if a perfectly happy marriage be one in which there is a genuine and complete union and understanding, on the spiritual, mental, and emotional planes, ours is such.\" Shortly before his death, the Aga Khan III chose a location on the West Bank of the Nile as his final resting place. The location was highly symbolic, for centuries earlier the Aga Khan's ancestors had founded the Fatimid dynasty with its capital in Cairo. The Fatimids represented one of the apogees of Muslim culture, being patrons of the arts, architecture, literature, pluralism and scientific endeavors, all fields that were equally dear to the Aga Khan III and Om Habibeh. Immediately after her husband's death, she oversaw the building of a mausoleum, a task that took 16 months and the help of architect Farid El-Shafie and contractor Hassan Dorraegum Om Habibeh is often remembered as the 'Red Rose' due to her daily ritual of placing a red rose upon the tomb of her husband during the time she spent in Egypt. When she was away, she arranged for the ritual to be carried out by the gardener. Her relationship with the Aga Khan III is widely remembered as a great love story and has been called a legendary and storybook romance.

The band are noted for their quirky mix of DIY garage rock, shambling post-punk, and delicate introspection. They are considered to be one of the last bands of the DIY era, and have been compared to The Fall, Swell Maps, and Captain Beefheart. After leaving Stoke-based group The Pits in 1980, Tim Shutt moved to London. In February 1981, he decided to rerecord two of The Pits' songs: \"Hamburger Boy\", and \"Switch\". Phil Bourne and Dave Robbins from The Colors Out of Time played guitar and bass for the session, Shutt's then-housemate Kevin Rodgers filled in on drums, and an old bandmate of Shutt's, Paul Johnston, came along to help out. This recording was to be the beginning of Happy Refugees. Shutt has since explained their choice of name: \"I [liked] the idea of us all being refugees from something. 'Happy' was added to the band name. [Paul Johnston] was adamant that it should not have 'The' added. The name of the band was to be Happy Refugees.\" The band was initially a four-piece, made up of Shutt, Johnston, and Rodgers, with a friend from college, Paul Lamb, playing bass. Their first formal release as a group was the double A-sided single Warehouse Sound / Enshrined in a Memory in 1982. It was released on their own imprint, Gymnasium Records, and distributed by Red Rhino, a member of the Cartel. This first single was met with acclaim, albeit underground. Nick Flynn and Paul Harvey joined later that year on keyboard and guitar, and the band began to write material for their first studio album, Last Chance Saloon, as well as playing in clubs around London. Last Chance Saloon was recorded in a single day in May 1983 to save money, and was released in early 1984. Although the band split up weeks after recording the album, Shutt and Johnston carried on performing under the Happy Refugees moniker until 1986. Rodgers and Flynn formed their own band with their friend Clive Williams, called The Hotel Complex, while Harvey moved to Newcastle to join Pauline Murray's band, and was later to join the reformed Penetration in 2001.<PIC> In 2010, after a two and a half decade hiatus from music, Shutt received a phone call from Dan Selzer, who wanted to rerelease Last Chance Saloon on New York-based Acute Records. Return to Last Chance Saloon was released in 2011, and included the band's 1982 single, as well as outtakes and demos not included on the original LP. It was made available both on vinyl and as a downloadable package, and was well received. Happy Refugees reformed that same year, with Hotel Complex bassist Clive Williams replacing Lamb, who had died in 2007. The group visited New York to promote the record. While there, they recorded a live session on WFMU, as well as several other live performances, one as guests of American indie-rockers Crystal Stilts at The Knitting Factory, Brooklyn. The band described themselves as inspired by the experience, and returned to the UK to write and record the songs for a second album, released on Gymnasium Records, with Harvey, by then a leading stuckist, providing the cover art. This album, titled Beyond Moth and Rust, was made available on iTunes and Spotify on 22 December 2014, and was officially released in vinyl format on 23 February 2015.own in a 2012 exhibition of great punk graphics at the Hayward Gallery, London.

Enfield was established as a village in 1843 by George Hickox as group of 44 quarter-acre blocks. Hickox named the village after his birthplace in Middlesex, United Kingdom.

Pine Forest in Gurney Terrace, was built in the 1850s by colonist Charles French Folland Snr. Barton Vale in Walker Court was the first \"grand home\" built by pastoralist Edmund Bowman, who arrived in the colony in 1839. The house was originally part of a farm, and was occupied by the Bowman family until 1922. After being acquired by the Salvation Army, it was became Barton Vale Girls' Home.Taken over by the state government in 1947, it was renamed Vaughan House Training School for Girls, named after Adelaide social reformer Dorothy Vaughan (1881\u20131974), and used as a government-run reformatory (\"home for wayward girls\") and known as Vaughan House until 1979. From then until 1993 it was renamed the South Australian Youth Remand and Assessment Centre. Singer-songwriter Ruby Hunter was placed in this home after having an argument with her foster brother in the family in which she had been previously placed. St. Clement's Anglican Church on Main North Road had its Foundation Stone laid on the 27th July 1858 but the Church was not opened for worship until 1867.

He made his name in 2004 by scoring a stunning last-minute goal from long range to give Liverpool a 2\u20131 victory over Arsenal at Anfield. Mellor also scored a vital goal and set up another during Liverpool's match with Olympiacos at Anfield during the group stage of the 2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League, which Liverpool went on to win. In December 2011, a knee injury sustained following a tackle by Milton Keynes striker Jabo Ibehre resulted in Mellor being forced into announcing his retirement on 9 May 2012. Since his retirement, Mellor has been doing media work, including match updates for Sky Sports News and work for LFC TV. Mellor is the son of former Manchester City, Norwich City, Sheffield Wednesday and Brighton and Hove Albion player Ian Mellor. A strong, physical, centre forward, Mellor was top scorer in Liverpool's run to the FA Youth Cup semi-final during the 2000\u201301 season scoring eight goals in four games.He was also the top scorer for the under-19 team and Joe Corrigan's reserves during the 2001\u201302 season and in total scored 46 goals (56 including friendlies). Mellor progressed through the ranks at Liverpool and in the 2002\u201303 season he scored 20 goals for the reserve team. He made his first team debut in the same season and played a total of six games and scored in a League Cup semi-final match against Sheffield United. Although the Reds lost the match 2\u20131, Mellor showed promise and was rewarded in March 2003 with a new three-year contract running to 2006. Despite his goal he was left out of the squad for the victorious 2003 Football League Cup Final. Manager G\u00e9rard Houllier sent Mellor on a year-long loan to West Ham United in August 2003. He scored two goals in the 3\u20130 win over Crystal Palace at the end of September, but aninjury hit spell at Upton Park, in addition to playing under three different managers and being forced to play out of position, proved unsettling. Mellor was soon back at Anfield and hit 10 goals in just four games for the reserves. Before the start of the 2004\u201305 season, Mellor suffered a knee injury but regained fitness and a return to the first team in the 3\u20130 League Cup victory at Millwall. In the next round he scored two goals to knock out holders Middlesbrough, and in late November he started a UEFA Champions League game at Monaco. After becoming a fixture in first team squad, Mellor burst into the starting team with some style. With Liverpool and Arsenal level at 1\u20131 with 90 minutes gone at Anfield in November 2004, he cracked in a sensational 30-yard volley to win the game for Liverpool. Things got better still for Mellor ten days later when Liverpool were being held 1\u20131 by Olympiacos in a game they had to win by two clear goals to progress to the Champions League knock out stages. He was brought into the game to replace Milan Baro\u0161 and within two minutes, he scored with a typical goal poacher's finish. Then, a cushioned header from Mellor set up Steven Gerrard to rifle in the third Liverpool goal and seal Liverpool's place in the last 16.He scored his second and what proved to be his final league goal for Liverpool in December 2004 in the 3\u20131 win over Newcastle at Anfield. In March 2005, Mellor was ruled out for the remainder of the 2004\u201305 season after undergoing surgery on both knees. This robbed the young striker of his chance of European glory as his teammates succeeded in bringing a fifth European cup back to Anfield. Although Mellor played no part in the knock out stages, his contribution to that year's success was massive. Mellor returned to action for the Liverpool reserve side in the 2005\u201306 season coming on as a substitute in their 2\u20130 victory at Manchester United in December 2005. He was back on the scoresheet in his first start in a year as Liverpool cruised into the quarter-finals of the Liverpool Senior Cup after a 3\u20130 win over Runcorn. In January 2006, Mellor joined Wigan Athletic on loan for the remainder of the season. In his first match against Middlesbrough, he scored the winner during injury time in a 3\u20132 victory. However, further knee injuries that required more surgery ended his spell at Wigan after three games. In 2006, despite a relative lack of first-team football at Liverpool, Mellor was voted into 90th position in a poll to find 100 Players Who Shook the Kop, ahead of such players as Mohamed Sissoko and Nigel Clough. After his retirement from professional football, Mellor returned to Liverpool to do media and commentary work with their in-house television company LFC TV. In August 2006, Mellor signed a three-year contract with Football League Championship club Preston North End for an undisclosed fee, thought to be in the region of \u00a31.5m. Manager Paul Simpson said, \"Neil is a goalscorer and hopefully that will continue to be the case. He is a tremendous signing. He has had his injury problems but we are happy he is over those and it's just a case now of building up his fitness levels.\" Another knee injury suffered in a pre-season friendly against Bolton Wanderers required more surgery and delayed Mellor's debut for Preston. Mellor finally got his first goal for Preston in the 3\u20131 victory over Southampton in March 2007. Out of favour under the Paul Simpson managerial era, Mellor had to prove himself over again to new P.N.E boss Alan Irvine. Under Irvine, Mellor finally got going and scored nine goals under him after Christmas 2007. Mellor again showed his panache for the 30-yard volley on 30 July 2008 by scoring in similar fashion for Preston North End in their friendly against Motherwell at Fir Park, which earned a 1\u20131 draw for Preston. During pre-season 2008\u201309 Mellor scored eight goals. Despite the promising pre-season and Mellor being a favourite amongst sections of the Deepdale crowd, indifferent form led to him losing his place to new signing Jon Parkin. Mellor regained his place in the team in time to score in Preston's 3\u20131 victory away at local rivals Blackpool, but another injury saw him miss a number of games. He regained fitness for a match against former club Liverpool in the FA Cup 3rd round, which Preston lost 2\u20130. Mellor scored his first goal for Preston North End since March 2010 on the opening day of the 2011\u201312 season, scoring their first goal in a 4\u20132 defeat to Colchester United at Deepdale. In the December of that season, Mellor picked up a knee injury in the 1\u20130 win over Milton Keynes and was ruled out for three months. After an injury-plagued season at Preston, Mellor announced his retirement on 9 May 2012.<PIC> On 2 July 2010, Mellor rejoined former manager Alan Irvine at Football League One side Sheffield Wednesday on a season long loan. Mellor played his first league game for The Owls on 7 August 2010 against Dagenham & Redbridge, coming on as a substitute in place of Clinton Morrison. He scored his first professional career hat-trick for Sheffield Wednesday on 10 November 2010 in a 4\u20131 win at Hillsborough over Hartlepool United in the Football League Trophy.ophy", "images": ["w_s199"], "tokens": 1709}]}

His father was Labour MP and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Philip Noel-Baker. Born in London, Noel-Baker was educated at Westminster School and King's College, Cambridge and served with the Intelligence Corps in World War II. He was first elected to the House of Commons in the Labour landslide at the 1945 general election as Member of Parliament for Brentford and Chiswick. When elected, he was the youngest Labour MP. He lost his seat at the 1950 general election, but returned to Parliament at the 1955 election as MP for Swindon. He resigned his seat in March 1969, by taking the Chiltern Hundreds. In 1971 he left the Labour Party in response to the party's opposition to British membership of the European Economic Community. He later joined the Social Democratic Party and later still the Conservative Party. In 1948, Francis acted covertly for the British Government inside Francoist Spain. His report \"Spanish Summary\" with a foreword written by Lady Megan Lloyd George M.P. had a huge influence in shaming the British and other governments and worldwide organisations for allowing Francoist Spain to remain undefeated in Europe until the Spanish transition to democracy.Though Francis duly lost his seat in the 1950 election, he won Swindon by a small majority in 1955 and increased it beyond the 10,000 mark over the two following elections. Vociferous in parliament, diligent in his constituency, and gradually taking charge at the family estate on the large Aegean island of Euboea, he managed \u2013 for a time at least \u2013 to reconcile socialism in Britain with feudalism, albeit enlightened and benign, in Greece. Fluent in modern Greek, in 1956 he played a semi-official part in the Tory government's dealings with the Greek Cypriot leader Archbishop Makarios and the Enosis independence movement in Cyprus. In fact, there were times when he gave the impression of being at Westminster, Swindon, Euboea and Cyprus simultaneously. In 1959 his father won a Nobel peace prize, and when Harold Wilson became Labour prime minister in 1964, both Philip and Francis were led to expect jobs in the new administration. However, the telephone calls never came. Francis was bitterly disappointed at being overlooked. In April 1967, the democratic west was shocked by a military coup in Greece. The regime established by \"the colonels\" was widely condemned, but not by Francis, who knew more about politics in Athens than most. He maintained that the colonels' rule represented reform from the prevalent political corruption, and a way forward for ordinary Greeks. His undisguised support of the new regime made his political life in Britain increasingly precarious, indeed untenable, and in time affected his health. In 1968 he announced his intention not to contest the 1970 election, and retired from parliament the following year. In the period that ensued, he spent an increasing proportion of his time in Greece, becoming active in a range of Cypriot, environmental and charitable activities. As a lordly host with his wife and family at his beloved Achmetaga, he displayed generosity, humour, and loyalty to friends in all walks of life.While he was an MP Noel-Baker advocated reforms to moderate the influence of outside interests in Parliament. In 1961 he published an article in Parliamentary Affairs warning that \"the door, in fact, is wide open for a new form of political corruption, and there is an uneasy feeling in Parliament and outside that its extent could be much greater than the known or published facts reveal\". Before his death in 2009 Noel-Baker was one of the few surviving members of the 1945 Parliament, the others being Michael Foot and John Freeman. He married in 1947 (dissolved 1956), Ann Saunders. In 1957 he married secondly Barbara Sonander, who died of skin cancer in 2004.

Every procession is led by a crossbearer carrying a cross. The role of the crossbearer is an immense honor on the island, and is determined as many as 20 years in advance. The crossbearer goes in the accompaniment of helpers, two followers that carry the big candle holders, two lead singers and several responders that sing the Gospin pla\u010d. All are dressed in formal suits \u2013 white brotherhood tunics. By number, the biggest one is the Procession of Jelsa, in which the number of pilgrims can surpass one thousand. Others are significantly smaller, and only the one from the village Pitve can surpass one hundred pilgrims. The Procession of Jelsa is also specific after the custom that the crossbearer runs across the last hundred meters of the way. Passing through all six villages included in the procession, the participants show their piety in all the churches on the way. The priest in every of the churches blesses the crossbearer and encourages him, and the singers sing the Gospin pla\u010d, and the walking continues. The processions must not meet, and to accomplish this, their movements are carefully coordinated. During the way, the pilgrims pray and sing, and particularly impressive is the singing of the Gospin pla\u010d in the original form.

The E-belt model was developed by William F. Bottke, David Vokrouhlicky, David Minton, David Nesvorn\u00fd, Alessandro Morbidelli, Ramon Brasser, Bruce Simonson and Harold Levison. It describes the dynamics of an inner band of the early asteroid belt within the framework of the Nice model. The extended-belt asteroids were located between the current inner boundary of the asteroid belt and the orbit of Mars with semi-major axis ranging from 1.7 to 2.1 astronomical units (AU). In the current Solar System most orbits in this region are unstable due to the presence of the \u03bd6 secular resonance. However, prior to the giant planet migration described in the Nice model the outer planets would have been in a more compact configuration with nearly circular orbits. With the planets in this configuration the \u03bd6 secular resonance would be located outside the asteroid belt. Stable orbits would have existed inside 2.1 AU and the inner edge of the primordial asteroid belt would have been defined by Mars-crossing orbits.During the migration of the giant planets the \u03bd6 secular resonance would have moved inward as Saturn moved outward. Upon reaching its current location near 2.1 AU the \u03bd6 secular resonance and other related resonances would destabilize the orbits of the E-belt asteroids. Most would be driven onto planet-crossing orbits as their eccentricities and inclinations increased. Over a period of 400 million years impacts of the E-belt asteroids yield an estimated 9-10 of the 12 basin-forming lunar impacts attributed to the Late Heavy Bombardment. As their orbits evolved many of the E-belt asteroids would have acquired orbits similar to those of the Hungaria asteroids with high inclinations and semimajor axis between 1.8 and 2.0 AU. Because orbits in this region are dynamicallysticky these objects would form a quasi-stable reservoir. As this population of the E-belt asteroids leaked from this reservoir they would produce a long-lived tail of impacts after the traditional end of the late heavy bombardment at 3.7 billion years ago. A remnant representing roughly 0.1\u20130.4% of the original E-belt asteroids would remain as the current Hungaria asteroids. Evidence for the Moon does not support comets from the outer planetesimal belt as the source of the basin-forming lunar impacts. The size frequency distribution (SFD) of ancient lunar craters is a similar to the SFD of main belt asteroids instead of that of comets. Samples recovered from the Moon containing impact melts have a range of ages rather than the sharp spike expected if comets produced the LHB. Analysis of highly siderophile elements in these samples shows a better match for impactors from the inner Solar System than for comets. Studies of the dynamics of the main asteroid belt during giant planet migration have significantly limited the number of impactors originating from this region. A rapid alteration of Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits is necessary to reproduce the current orbital distribution.This scenario removes only 50% of the asteroids from the main belt producing 2\u20133 basins on the Moon. Examination of samples recovered from the Moon indicates that the impactors were thermally evolved objects. E-type asteroids, an example of this type, are uncommon in the main belt but become more common toward the inner belt and would be expected to be most common in the E-belt. The Hungaria asteroids, which are a remnant of the E-belt in this model, contain a sizable fraction of E-type asteroids. The decay of the population of E-belt asteroids captured onto Hungaria like orbits produces a long-lived tail of impacts which continues past the LHB. The continuation of the bombardment is predicted to generate basin-forming impacts on the Earth and Chicxulub-sized craters on the Earth and Moon. Impact craters on the Moon and impact spherule beds found on the Earth dated to this period are consistent with these predictions. The E-belt model predicts a remnant population will remain on Hungaria-like orbits. The initial population of E-belt asteroids was calculated based on the population of potential basin-forming impactors remaining among the Hungaria asteroids. The result was consistent with calculations based on the recent estimates of the orbital density of the main asteroid belt before the planetary migration.<PIC>", "images": ["w_s259"], "tokens": 1081}]}

The technique was invented by Czech player Anton\u00edn Panenka, who introduced it to the world in the UEFA Euro 1976 final in Belgrade, when he beat West German goalkeeper Sepp Maier to claim the title for the Czechoslovakia national team. After its much publicised debut in the tournament, the Panenka kick has been used on rare occasions and mostly by highly respected players who can deal with the consequences of missing such an attempt. Originally, in Czech language the kick is called Vr\u0161ovick\u00fd dloub\u00e1k - a reference to the Prague district of Vr\u0161ovice, where Panenka's home club Bohemians is based. This style of penalty kick is also called Il cucchiaio (\"the spoon\") in Italy, cavadinha (\"little dig\") in Brazil and penal picado (\"poked penalty kick\") in Argentina and elsewhere in South America.<PIC> The aim of the technique is not to chip the ball over the goalkeeper, but to take advantage of the fact that many goalkeepers will dive to either side of the goal in anticipation, rather than waiting to see in which direction the ball is going. It is a very risky technique, because the subtle touch on the ball gives it a very slow speed, thus allowing the goalkeeper to move back from where they jumped, or even to simply remain in the same spot and wait for the ball to fall easily into their hands.

{"id": 30095, "dataset": "wiki", "images": ["w_s328"], "chunks": [{"chunk_id": 1, "text": "The histone code is a hypothesis that the transcription of genetic information encoded in DNA is in part regulated by chemical modifications to histone proteins, primarily on their unstructured ends. Together with similar modifications such as DNA methylation it is part of the epigenetic code. Histones associate with DNA to form nucleosomes, which themselves bundle to form chromatin fibers, which in turn make up the more familiar chromosome. Histones are globular proteins with a flexible N-terminus (taken to be the tail) that protrudes from the nucleosome. Many of the histone tail modifications correlate very well to chromatin structure and both histone modification state and chromatin structure correlate well to gene expression levels. The critical concept of the histone code hypothesis is that the histone modifications serve to recruit other proteins by specific recognition of the modified histone via protein domains specialized for such purposes, rather than through simply stabilizing or destabilizing the interaction between histone and the underlying DNA. These recruited proteins then act to alter chromatin structure actively or to promote transcription. For details of gene expression regulation by histone modifications see table below.The hypothesis is that chromatin-DNA interactions are guided by combinations of histone modifications. While it is accepted that modifications (such as methylation, acetylation, ADP-ribosylation, ubiquitination, citrullination, SUMO-ylation and phosphorylation) to histone tails alter chromatin structure, a complete understanding of the precise mechanisms by which these alterations to histone tails influence DNA-histone interactions remains elusive. However, some specific examples have been worked out in detail. For example, phosphorylation of serine residues 10 and 28 on histone H3 is a marker for chromosomal condensation. Similarly, the combination of phosphorylation of serine residue 10 and acetylation of a lysine residue 14 on histone H3 is a tell-tale sign of active transcription. Well characterized modifications to histones include: Methylation: Both lysine and arginine residues are known to be methylated. Methylated lysines are the best understood marks of the histone code, as specific methylated lysine match well with gene expression states. Methylation of lysines H3K4 and H3K36 is correlated with transcriptional activation while demethylation of H3K4 is correlated with silencing of the genomic region. Methylation of lysines H3K9 and H3K27 is correlated with transcriptional repression. Particularly, H3K9me3 is highly correlated with constitutive heterochromatin. Methylation of histone lysine also has a role in DNA repair. For instance, H3K36me3 is required for homologous recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks, and H4K20me2 facilitates repair of such breaks by non-homologous end joining.Acetylation\u2014by HAT (histone acetyl transferase); deacetylation\u2014by HDAC (histone deacetylase): Acetylation tends to define the 'openness' of chromatin as acetylated histones cannot pack as well together as deacetylated histones. Phosphorylation Ubiquitination SUMOylation However, there are many more histone modifications, and sensitive mass spectrometry approaches have recently greatly expanded the catalog. A very basic summary of the histone code for gene expression status is given below (histone nomenclature is described here): H2BK5ac H3K4me1 - primed enhancers H3K4me3 is enriched in transcriptionally active promoters. H3K9me2 -repression H3K9me3 is found in constitutively repressed genes. H3K27me3 is found in facultatively repressed genes. H3K36me H3K36me2 H3K36me3 is found in actively transcribed gene bodies. H3K79me2 H3K9ac is found in actively transcribed promoters. H3K14ac is found in actively transcribed promoters.H3K23ac H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from poised enhancers. H3K36ac H3K56ac is a proxy for de novo histone assembly. H3K122ac is enriched in poised promoters and also found in a different type of putative enhancer that lacks H3K27ac. H4K5ac H4K8ac H4K12ac H4K16ac H4K20me H4K91ac Unlike this simplified model, any real histone code has the potential to be massively complex; each of the four standard histones can be simultaneously modified at multiple different sites with multiple different modifications. To give an idea of this complexity, histone H3 contains nineteen lysines known to be methylated\u2014each can be un-, mono-, di- or tri-methylated. If modifications are independent, this allows a potential 419 or 280 billion different lysine methylation patterns, far more than the maximum number of histones in a human genome (6.4 Gb / ~150 bp = ~44 million histones if they are very tightly packed). And this does not include lysine acetylation (known for H3 at nine residues), arginine methylation (known for H3 at three residues) or threonine/serine/tyrosine phosphorylation (known for H3 at eight residues), not to mention modifications of other histones.Every nucleosome in a cell can therefore have a different set of modifications, raising the question of whether common patterns of histone modifications exist. A study of about 40 histone modifications across human gene promoters found over 4000 different combinations used, over 3000 occurring at only a single promoter. However, patterns were discovered including a set of 17 histone modifications that are present together at over 3000 genes. Therefore, patterns of histone modifications do occur but they are very intricate, and we currently have detailed biochemical understanding of the importance of a relatively small number of modifications. Structural determinants of histone recognition by readers, writers and erasers of the histone code are revealed by a growing body of experimental data.<PIC>", "images": ["w_s328"], "tokens": 1496}]}

The work in mathematical analysis, notably including what is now universally known as Green's theorem, is of the greatest importance in all branches of mathematical physics. It contains the first exposition of the theory of potential. In physics, Green's theorem is mostly used to solve two-dimensional flow integrals, stating that the sum of fluid outflows at any point inside a volume is equal to the total outflow summed about an enclosing area. In plane geometry, and in particular, area surveying, Green's theorem can be used to determine the area and centroid of plane figures solely by integrating over the perimeter. It is in this essay that the term 'potential function' first occurs. Herein also his remarkable theorem in pure mathematics, since universally known as Green's theorem, and probably the most important instrument of investigation in the whole range of mathematical physics, made its appearance.We are all now able to understand, in a general way at least, the importance of Green's work, and the progress made since the publication of his essay in 1828. But to fully appreciate his work and subsequent progress one needs to know the outlook for the mathematico-physical sciences as it appeared to Green at this time and to realize his refined sensitiveness in promulgating his discoveries.<PIC> Poisson's electrical and magnetical investigations were generalized and extended in 1828 by George Green. Green's treatment is based on the properties of the function already used by Lagrange, Laplace, and Poisson, which represents the sum of all the electric or magnetic charges in the field, divided by their respective distances from some given point: to this function Green gave the name potential, by which it has always since been known.we to his genius.

It was written by Ben Jonson at the request of Anne of Denmark, the queen consort of King James I, who wished the masquers to be disguised as Africans. Anne was one of the performers in the masque along with her court ladies, all of whom appeared in blackface makeup. The plot of the masque follows the ladies arriving at the royal court to be \"cleansed\" of their blackness by King James; a stage direction that was impossible to fulfill on stage. As a result, The Masque of Beauty was written as a sequel to The Masque of Blackness. The Masque of Beauty, originally intended for the following holiday season, was displaced by Hymenaei, the masque for the wedding of the Earl of Essex and Frances Howard. Beauty was finally performed in 1608. The sets, costumes, and stage effects were designed by Inigo Jones; Blackness was the first of many masques for the Stuart Court on which Jonson and Jones would collaborate. The music for Blackness was composed by Alfonso Ferrabosco.Jones designed a raised and mobile stage for the masque, forty feet square and four feet off the floor; this was employed for many subsequent masques. The stage contained inner space for the machines that produced stage effects and the technicians who operated them. The King was often stilling on a stool, resembling the sun. Blackness introduced effects that Jones would repeat with variation throughout his career as a stage designer: it opened with a tempestuous seascape, simulated by flowing and billowing cloths. The opening stormy sea was populated with six blue-haired merman-like tritons. The gods Oceanus (\"blue\") and Niger (black) entered, mounted upon giant seahorses. The twelve daughters of Niger, played by the Queen and her ladies in waiting, entered in the company of a dozen nymphs of Oceanus as torchbearers; the ladies of the Court were dressed in tones of silver and azure to contrast with the blackness of the makeup, with pearls and feathers in their hair, while the torchbearers, in green doublets with gold puffed sleeves, had their faces, hands, and hair dyed blue. The ladies rode in a great hollow seashell, which seemed to float upon and move with the waves, and was accompanied by six large sea monsters carrying more torchbearers. (With Blackness as with many subsequent masques designed by Jones, one of the aspects of the show most commented upon by witnesses was the dazzling intensity of light involved...which inevitably says something about the normal conditions of life in the Jacobean era.)<PIC> The text begins with Niger talking to his father Oceanus. Oceanus asks him why he has left his usual eastward course and flowed westward, into the Atlantic. Niger tells him that he has come to request help. Niger's daughters are upset because they thought themselves to be the most beautiful goddesses in the world, only to discover that paleness is thought more attractive - and so no longer feel beautiful.Controversy also stemmed from the predominant role of female actresses playing what were considered traditionally male roles. The texts of The Masque of Blackness and The Masque of Beauty were published together in quarto form in 1608, by the bookseller Thomas Thorpe; they were reprinted in the first folio collection of Jonson's works in 1616.", "images": ["w_s380"], "tokens": 843}]}

It is one of many Samoan log drum variants and is of the slit drum family, and therefore is also of the idiophone percussion family. It is made from a hollowed-out log, usually of Miro wood and produces a distinctive and loud sound. Different sizes of log drums offer different pitches and volumes, as well as striking the log drum in the middle or near the ends. Talipalau drums are a Samoan variant a little larger than a pate drum and somewhat smaller than the Lali log drum variant. The dimensions of some Talipalau are large as 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) high and 3 metres (9.8 ft) in length; these Talipalau are a distant cousin to the Fijian Lali drum which were larger in size. The smaller pate was said to be introduced to Samoa by inter-married Tahitians whom visited and settled in Samoa some 500 years ago. However, in recent times the pate is used together with the other lesser known traditional log drum variants as well as the Samoan fala as percussive musical instruments.Because of the widespread distribution of Samoan music through the great Polynesian expansion, the use of the P\u0101t\u0113 has gained much popularity among other neighbouring Polynesian Islands such as Uvea and Futuna, Tokelau, Tuvalu and Niue. There are five main Samoan wooden slit drum variants: The logo, often carved straight from the carcass of giant felled trees, is the largest of the Samoan drum variants. Some of these drums were said to need upward of 70 men to carry them to the sea\u2014such was the enormity of the drums that they could only be transported by flotation. When carved into a drum, the logo can only be played by being struck from the side, for instance by sliding the beater or very large log like playing stick across the top of the drum to hit the slit lip on the other side. The logo was used to announce the King of Samoa, High Chiefs and other monarchy in the past. The logo was also used to announce attacks and signals during war (see: Samoan Civil War, the Fijian Wars and also the Tongan Wars). Samoa also has recorded historical records of lesser known battles with the neighboring islands of Manono, Pukapuka, Tokelau, Tuamotu and Rarotonga, although these battles may be classed as independent isolated inter-island skirmishes between large familial clan groups. Lali are large drums that are always played in pairs by two drummers. One of them beats the larger of the two, called the Tatasi. The other drummer plays the smaller Lali in the rhythmic pattern called the Talua. Both slit drums are played with sticks called Auta. The Lali were said to be introduced 700 years ago via Fiji. The talipalau is a medium-sized Lali drum in between the normal-sized lali and the pate. The talipalau slit drum was introduced to Samoa via Tuamotu and Tahiti. It is now part of the island group now part of the French Polynesian Island chain. The archipelago of Samoa, Tahiti and Tuamotu developed inter-island familial bonded clans over the span of 800 years. The pate was introduced via Tahiti 500 years ago.It is the most well-known of the drum variants simply because of its portability and easy-to-use size, as well as because of its various different tones and pitches. The fa'aali'i-nafa is a smaller indigenous Samoan pate drum also made from Milo wood. Tahitian warriors introduced intricate wooden log pate drumming to the Samoan Islands and the Cook Islands. In Rarotonga its origins have grown into deep spiritual roots that are still found in Cook Islands drumming today. In Samoa log drums have traditionally been used in communicating over large distances in times of war and for signaling times of Sa, Chief and Village Meetings. Drums are also used in traditional song and dance. In Tahiti the people have taken a more contemporary approach where drumming and dancing is used more for entertainment and tourism than traditional functions. For example, French Polynesia celebrates the annual Heiva i Tahiti festival where different tribes and island clan groups are able to compete against each other in a dance and drumming competition.<PIC> First a segment of a hardwood tree trunk or thick branch is taken and stripped of its bark. Holes are then bored into the log in a straight line, from one end to the other, optionally leaving some space at each end. What remains in between the holes is then chiseled out, forming the characteristic slit. After this, the log continues to be hollowed out through the slit. Both the shape of the slit and the extent that the log is gutted will affect the tone and pitch of the pate.", "images": ["w_s411"], "tokens": 1157}]}

It strives to advocate for the national recognition of Castile, and in some cases, its independence. Other current political parties include Tierra Comunera, Castilian Party, and Ahora Castilla. Castilian Left and the other parties are categorized as part of a major political movement known as Castilian nationalism. It defends the traditions and values from the rebels of the Castilian War of the Communities, so they call themselves \"comuneros\". As a group of Castilian nationalists, they also seek to unify the other Spanish Autonomous Communities of Cantabria, Castile y Leon, Castile-La Mancha, La Rioja, and Madrid. Izquierda Castellana constituted a definitive movement in Madrid by the year 2002, as a section of Izquierda Comunera, which also included the organizations Unidad Popular Castellana, YESCA (formerly known as Juventudes Castellanas Revolucionarias), Mujeres Castellanas and the C\u00edrculo Castellano de Toledo.The Communist Party of the Castilian People (a section of the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain in the autonomous region of Castilla y Le\u00f3n) joined on as part of Izquierda Castellana, but later left the organization. Izquierda Castellana also supports various nationalist movements around the world, such as those in the Basque Country, Palestine or Ireland, emphasizing a democratic perspective and the sovereignty of the working class. The goal of Izquierda Castellana is the attainment of what they call a united Castile, overcoming the current division of the Castilian \"nation\" between five autonomous regions (Cantabria, Castile and Le\u00f3n, Madrid, La Rioja and Castile-La Mancha) and a comarca (Requena-Utiel in the Valencian Community). It emphasizes socialism, sovereignty and republicanism, principles it reaffirms each year on April 23, in a special ceremony in the municipality of Villalar de los Comuneros. This day is celebrated by Castilian nationalist organizations such as Izquierda Castellana and Tierra Comunera as the National Day of Castile, but officially it is the festivity of the autonomous region of Castile and Le\u00f3n. A Castilian nationalist political party that seeks the defense of the rights and freedoms of the Castilian people, the constant exercise of their decision-making capacity, the progressive transformation of their society in order to achieve freedom and the preservation of their historical heritage, as the most valuable legacy to pass on to future generations. It currently does not assume a social, economic, and cultural role that defines Castile. It holds great value towards many aspects of the human nature, which includes cultural and environmental ideals, its production of raw materials of high quality, and most importantly, the existence of a political power at the service of its citizens, should allow the Castilian people build a society more prosperous and developed, that satisfaction appropriate to the needs of the people.As an organization that is fully committed to unify the Castilians amongst themselves and the rest of Spain, Tierra Comunera is responsible for multiple organized experiences that are developed by the people giving them continuity and gathering the best thing of all of them to plan a way that incorporates the illusion of all the persons and sectors that believe for a possible and united Castile. A Castilian youth organization that specialized in combat action that creates struggles by the Revolutionary Youth of their land: Castilla. Yesca arose from the militant representation that during the decade of the 90s and the early years of the new millennium that was carried out by the Revolutionary Youth Castilian. It was not simply a change of name but the natural evolution of the project after years of struggles and experiences of another step in the constructionof a real Spanish organization qualified to give answers to the problems that they suffer as young. Yesca is committed to bring together people that want to real changes in society, fighting from the framework of the construction of Castile between everyone. It is something that traditionally ignite the spark; the symbolic name presents to us as what we aspire to be and a catalytic tool of ideas and actions that will lead us to kindle the flame of the social revolution, gender and national they need. For the last three decades, tens of thousands of Castilian attend \"Villarlar of the Comuneros\" on April 23 to celebrate the day of Castile. The Battle of Villalar was a battle in the Revolt of the Comuneros fought near the town of Villalar in Valladolid province, Spain. The royalist supporters of King Charles I won a crushing victory over the comuneros rebels. Three of the most important rebel leaders were captured, Juan de Padilla, Juan Bravo, and Francisco Maldonado. They were executed the next day, effectively ending armed resistance to Charles I. The Battle of Villalar represents an important historical event in Castile because it marked the end of autocratic Spanish monarchy.<PIC>", "images": ["w_s416"], "tokens": 1171}]}

He was the grandson of John Brown (1722-1787), the renowned Scottish theologian and author. John Croumbie Brown received his education in Aberdeen, was later trained as a missionary, and in 1833 was sent to St. Petersburg by the London Missionary Society to mission to the British and American Church, spending four years there. From 1844 to 1848 he was in Cape Town where he took charge of the Congregational Church. Having an easy familiarity with the natural sciences, he presented a series of public lectures on scientific topics. His first lecture in November 1844 was under the aegis of the Cape Town Mental Improvement Society and was \"On the discoveries of modern astronomy\". This was followed by lectures on chemistry sponsored by the Institute for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. In 1847 he delivered lectures \"On the physiology and structure of the human frame\" - these lectures were subsequently published in book form in Cape Town. Returning to Scotland, Brown served as pastor in Aberdeen in 1849, continuing with his scientific lectures, which were well received.He furthered his botanical studies, and in April 1853 took up the post of lecturer in botany at the Joint Medical School (King's College, Aberdeen), also being awarded the degree Doctor of Laws there in 1858. In April 1863, following the death of Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Pappe, Brown took up the post of Colonial Botanist at the Cape, his duties including that of professor of botany at the South African College. He toured the Cape Colony during 1863, giving lectures in an effort to popularise botany. He opposed deforestation and veld-burning, because of the loss of soil moisture. He was consulted by the government on forestry matters, and wrote several memoirs on forestry, appending a list of South African trees, shrubs, and arborescent herbs, to his annual report for 1866. His reports also touched on agricultural issues, such as diseases in fruit trees, rust, manuring, the cultivation of various crops, experimental farms, irrigation, and Cape wines. His 1863 report included the first official record of \"krimpsiekte\" or Cotyledonosis in small stock, particularly goats, caused by three genera of the Crassulaceae (Cotyledon, Tylecodon and Kalanchoe). He investigated potential dam sites, and the hydrology of the country. In 1866 the post of Colonial Botanist was abolished due to shortage of funds and Brown returned to Scotland in January 1867. Some South African botanists were critical of Brown's contributions to botanical knowledge, but the noted Irish botanist William Henry Harvey singled out Brown for praise in the preface to Volume 3 of the Flora Capensis \"for his unremitting kind attention to the interests of this work, and for the zeal which he has shown, since his appointment, in endeavouring to promote the study of botany in all parts of the Colony, and among the neighbouring extra-colonial missionaries\". The Cape authorities also valued his suggestions, some of which were implemented.Hence he was not regarded as an outstanding botanist, but did successfully promote interest in botany and sound methods in agriculture, forestry, and veld management. Brown maintained his interest in the forestry and hydrology of the Cape Colony, publishing a number of valuable works. In April 1877 he addressed the Town Council of Edinburgh and the board of the Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society, advocating the establishment of a forestry school and arboretum in Edinburgh.

TMCM has appeared in comic strips, minicomics, webcomics, comic books, magazines, books, and operas. The Too Much Coffee Man comic book won the 1995 Eisner Award for Best New Series. Too Much Coffee Man first appeared in 1991, in the Too Much Coffee Man Minicomic, as a self-promotion for Wheeler's book Children with Glue (Blackbird Comics, 1991). The minicomics, which appeared in many different formats, even one issued as a one-inch square, were self-published, photocopied, and handmade by Wheeler in initial runs of 300 black-and-white copies. Wheeler said he created Too Much Coffee Man to make more accessible themes he had begun in a college newspaper.He said in 2011: In 1991, I drew an autobiographical cartoon for The Daily Texan with themes of alienation and loneliness. When I described it, people's eyes glazed over. As a cheap gag, I started Too Much Coffee Man. I still address the same themes, except now there's coffee. People like coffee. Too Much Coffee Man started as a one-page ongoing strip running in The Daily Texan in 1991. Over time, it became syndicated to a number of alternative weeklies throughout the U.S. With the January 23, 2006, installment, the \"Too Much Coffee Man\" strip was retitled \"How to Be Happy, with Too Much Coffee Man\". On February 6, 2006, the title was simplified to \"How to Be Happy\", and Too Much Coffee Man did not appear in the strip again until January 21, 2008. Wheeler published four issues of the Too Much Coffee Man minicomic in 1991\u20131992. Wheeler self-published the Too Much Coffee Man comic book via Adhesive Comics between 1993 and 2005. The first five issues were dated from July 1993 to February 1996. These were followed by three annual issues of Too Much Coffee Man's Color Special from 1996 to 1998. In July 1998, Adhesive released Too Much Coffee Man No. 8, thus skipping issues No. 6 and 7. After issue No. 10 (Dec. 2000), the comic became Too Much Coffee Man Magazine, featuring stories, articles, and reviews alongside TMCM material. Too Much Coffee Man strips appeared in the Austin, Texas-based anthology, Jab issues #1\u20134 and No. 6, published by Wheeler's own imprint Adhesive Comics from 1992 to 1995. In 1994 TMCM appeared in the independent anthology Hands Off!, published by Washington Citizens for Fairness. From 1994 to 1996, Too Much Coffee Man stories ran in the Dark Horse Comics anthology series Dark Horse Presents, in issues #92\u201395, and #100\u2013111. Dark Horse collected all the TMCM stories from Dark Horse Presents in the 1997 special Too Much Coffee Man \"Saves the Universe\". 1997 was a banner year for Too Much Coffee Man, with stories in the SPX: Small Press Expo anthology, Caliber Press's Negative Burn No.50, the Head Press anthology No Justice, No Piece!, and the trade paperback Wake Up and Smell the Cartoons of Shannon Wheeler, published by Mojo Press.

With the earnings from a Converse shoe commercial, Wheeler purchased a computer, launched his website tmcm.com on December 7, 1995, and began posting his comics online. He continues to post new and newly colored Too Much Coffee Man cartoons on his website every week. Through multi-layered narratives, the comic explores issues of politics and the toils of urban society, often through the lens of the comics scene and coffee shop culture. In addition to the titular character, the creator of the strip often appears as a character, as does a \"reader\" character. Too Much Coffee Man \u2014 Although he spends most time in his apartment or at the local coffee shop debating with his often pessimistic cohorts, Too Much Coffee Man is capable of going into a \"manic paranoid frenzy\" in combat, allowing him to pulverize opponents. He gains his amazing powers from coffee and cigarettes \u2013 he distills his extra potent espresso mix in a secret laboratory above the coffee shop. TMCM rarely sleeps and his nerves are shot from an excess of caffeine. He has also been in outer space and in a U.S. prison. Visually, the character is a parody of superheroes, which since their inception have been colloquially referred to by industry professionals as \"long-underwear characters\".Too Much Coffee Man wears literal long underwear, dressing in what appears to be a spandex version of old-fashioned red \"long johns\" (full-body underwear with a buttoned flap on the back for bodily functions) with a large mug attached atop his head; it remains unclear whether he is wearing it or whether it is physically part of him.

In 2000, jazz musician Bob Dorough recorded a CD entitled Too Much Coffee Man. The character appears on the cover, drawn by Shannon Wheeler, and there is a title track (originally intended to be music for an animated series based on the character) as well as a cover of the Richard Miles composition \"The Coffee Song\".<PIC> The Too Much Coffee Man Opera appeared on stage for the first time in 2006. Wheeler, fellow cartoonist Damian Willcox, and composer Daniel Steven Crafts adapted the strip into an opera. Too Much Coffee Man Opera debuted at Brunish Hall at the Center for Performing Arts in Portland, Oregon, on September 22, 2006. A sample performance, which preceded the debut, was given at the Opera America convention in Seattle, Washington. Wheeler later teamed with Portland-based comic Carolyn Main to write a second act.

Burciaga played youth soccer for the Dallas Texans Soccer Club and graduated from Duncanville High School where he was the 2000 District 7 soccer MVP and two-time All State. Instead of attending college, Burciaga opted to turn professional after finishing high school, signing a Project-40 contract with MLS. Burciaga was selected 12th overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by the Kansas City Wizards. Although a star with United States youth national teams, he was not immediately ready for MLS. He played two games on loan to the Portland Timbers of the USL A-League. He also played three games for Project 40 and one game with the Pittsburgh Riverhounds in an August 2001 U.S. Open Cup game. He finished the season with the Wizards with three games, two of them starts. Burciaga tore his left knee's ACL in preseason and missed the entire 2002 season rehabbing the injury.He came on strong in 2003, earning the left back starting position in preseason and looking poised to finally come into his own; he tore his right knee's ACL in the fourth game of the season and so finished the year with only those four starts. After two painful years, Burciaga returned to the Wizards' lineup in 2004 and was injury-free for the entire year. Given the opportunity, he seized the left back position and kept it all year long. He finished the season with 21 starts out of 24 games played, and added one goal and one assist. In 2005, Burciaga was selected out of all the MLS players to the MLS Select team vs. Real Madrid at the Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u for the Trofeo Bernabeu. 2006 was Burciaga's breakout year, as he scored 8 goals and 8 assists, several of them spectacular, in earning MLS Best XI honors for the first time and team MVP. Burciaga was traded by the Kansas City Wizards to league rivals Colorado Rapids on January 16, 2008, in return for a 2009 second round 2009 MLS SuperDraft pick. Colorado opted not to renew his contract for the 2009 season. Burciaga trialed with Orlando City during the 2011 preseason but was not offered a contract with the team. In the spring of 2012, Burciaga attempted to earn a roster spot with MLS side D.C. United but was not successful. He ended up playing in 2012 for the Atlanta Silverbacks of the second division NASL. Burciaga returned to professional soccer in late 2018, signing with the Major Arena Soccer League's Dallas Sidekicks.<PIC> In 2002, Burciaga founded the Wizards Futbol Club in Dallas, Texas. Established by Jose Luis Burciaga Sr. and Jose Luis Burciaga Jr., Wizards FC is a community based not for profit organization designed to provide a high level of training and development that will prepare all players for college and beyond. At the 2014 Dallas Cup, Wizards FC had two teams participating with one team going to the finals. On August 4, 2014, Wolverhampton Wanderers of England agreed to a partnership with Wizards FC.\"He can crush a ball,\" said former Kansas City teammate Jimmy Conrad. \"He can crush it, and even if it skips a few times, you know it's going in.\" \"That was the first goal scored on me in MLS Cup, so I took it pretty hard,\" recalled Nick Rimando, now manning the nets for Real Salt Lake. \"Ryan Nelsen was right there, and it went by him, and that's why I reacted a bit slow to it.

This type of contract requires a full and complete set of plans and specifications and includes all the indirect costs plus the profit and the contractor will receive progress payments each month minus retention. The flexibility of this contract is very minimal and changes in design or deviation from the original plans would require a change order paid by the owner. In this contract the payment is made according to the percentage of work completed. The lump sum contract is different from guaranteed maximum price in a sense that the contractor is responsible for additional costs beyond the agreed price, however, if the final price is less that the agreed price then the contractor will gain and benefit from the savings. There are some factors that make for a successful execution of a lump sum contract on a project such as experience and confidence, management skills, communication skills, having a clear work plan, proper list of deliverables, contingency, and dividing the responsibility among the project team.According to Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), \u201cIn a lump sum contract, the owner has essentially assigned all the risk to the contractor, who in turn can be expected to ask for a higher markup in order to take care of unforeseen contingencies. A Contractor under a lump sum agreement will be responsible for the proper job execution and will provide its own means and methods to complete the work.\u201d In lump sum Contracts or fixed-price contracts, the contractor is evaluating the value of work as per the documents available. Mainly these documents can be specifications and the drawings. In pre-tender stage Contractor evaluates the cost to execute the project (based on the above documents such as drawings, specifications, schedules, tender instruction and the clarification received for the raised queries). And the contrast to these documents Contractor is evaluating and agreeing with the owner (or employer) to complete the works without exceeding the agreed lump sum amount.<PIC> The owner's risk is reduced due to the price of the contract being fixed and variations are not as much like other contracts. There are fewer change orders and they are reduced. The bidding and contractor selection is less complicated. Obtaining construction loans are easier with this type of contract. The profit margins and percentages are greater for engineers and contractors. Payments and instalments are made on regular basis which provides the contractor with a reliable cash flow. Management of the contract is a lot easier for the owner. It creates an improved communication and relationship between the design team, contractor, and the owner. There is a higher risk for the contractor. Proper change order documentation is required which could be time-consuming. Higher fixed price due to unforeseen conditions. The contractor selection usually takes longer. The design has to be completed before the start of activities. Change orders could be rejected by the owner. It increases the adversarial relationship among the stakeholders of the project.al, where the former is for improvement of work quality, cost and schedule reduction, and the latter is a negative change in performance or quality of work due to client's financial difficulties. There are many reasons for variations to occur but main causes are normally due to omission in design, inadequate design, changes in specifications and scope, and lack of coordination and communication among the stakeholders.", "images": ["w_s476"], "tokens": 790}]}

Hawkins is also the all-time Great Britain number two (and European all-time number six) in the half marathon. He is the Great Scottish Run course record holder and was the first British man to win that event in 23 years. Hawkins was born on 22 June 1992 in Elderslie near Paisley. He has two elder brothers [Scott Hawkins, Derek. Callum and Derek were encouraged to take up distance running, and are trained by their father Robert, a former international runner. In 2010\u20132012 Hawkins competed for the Butler University in the United States, earning all-American status, and winning the 2011 Men's Athlete of the Year award for the Great Lakes Region. He was the first athlete from the Butler University to win the award. After that he studied mechanical engineering at the University of the West of Scotland. Some time before 2013 he had two surgeries on his left knee.At the 2010 IAAF World Cross Country Championships held in Bydgoszcz, Poland, Hawkins finished 47th in the junior men's race in a time of 24 minutes and 21 seconds. In 2013 he finished seventh in the men's under-23's race at the European Cross Country Championships. At the 2014 European Cross Country Championships he improved to a fifth-place finish in the under-23's race. Hawkins competed at the 2014 Commonwealth Games held in Glasgow, Scotland, representing the host nation in the men's 10,000 metres, finishing 20th. In October 2015 he finished the Great Scottish Run in a time of one hour two minutes and 42 seconds, setting a personal best to in second place overall behind Uganda's Moses Kipsiro and winning the gold medal for Scottish athletes. Later that month he competed in his first marathon in Frankfurt, finishing twelfth in two hours 12 minutes and 17seconds, in a race won by Ethiopia's Sisay Lemma. At the 2016 London Marathon, his second event over the distance, Hawkins finished eighth overall, and was the first British-qualified athlete to finish, in a time of two hours 10 minutes and 52 seconds. This time was inside the qualifying time of two hours 14 minutes needed to earn him a place in the Great Britain team for the 2016 Summer Olympics to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He was joined in the men's marathon by fellow British athletes, Tsegai Tewelde and his brother Derek Hawkins. Hawkins finished ninth in the marathon at the 2016 Olympics in a time of 2:11:52. In October 2016 he again ran the Great Scottish Run and this time was the overall winner of the event in 1:00:24. This would have been a new Scottish half-marathon record, but the race was found to be 150 m short, which invalidated the result. In January 2017 he became the first British athlete to beat Mo Farah in any race for 7 years at the Great Edinburgh International Cross Country race, which has been held annually since 2005.

In her early career, she competed with Egor Golovkin and Pavel Lebedev. She also competed one season with J\u00e9r\u00f4me Blanchard. Mukhortova was born in Saint Petersburg but began skating in her father's hometown of Lipetsk when she was 6 years old. She became attracted to pair skating, however, there were no related opportunities in Lipetsk so her mother took her back to Saint Petersburg when she was thirteen. Mukhortova and Maxim Trankov trained in the same practice group under coaches Ludmila Velikova and Nikolai Velikov, but with different partners. Mukhortova first competed with Pavel Lebedev during the 2001\u201302 and the 2002\u201303 season, skating with him on the ISU Junior Grand Prix and finishing fourth at the 2002 and 2003 World Junior Championships.The pair had frequent arguments but due to good results, Mukhortova initially declined to switch partners, however, a year later in 2003, she accepted Trankov's suggestion to skate together. In their first season together, they won the bronze medal at the Junior Grand Prix Final and the 2004 World Junior Championships. The following season, they competed on both the Grand Prix and Junior Grand Prix and won the 2005 World Junior Championships. In the 2005\u201306 Olympic season, they were assigned to the 2006 World Championships after Tatiana Totmianina / Maxim Marinin withdrew. They placed 12th in their debut at the event. After the 2005\u201306 season, Mukhortova and Trankov switched coaches to Tamara Moskvina. In August 2006, Artur Dmitriev became their coach and in December 2006 they moved to Oleg Vasiliev.

A right-handed pitcher, Lidle played in Major League Baseball with the New York Mets, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Oakland Athletics, Toronto Blue Jays, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Yankees from 1997 to 2006. Lidle was killed when the small aircraft he owned crashed into a residential building in New York City. Lidle graduated from South Hills High School in West Covina, California in 1990. He was a high school teammate of future major leaguers Jason Giambi and Aaron Small. Lidle was not drafted by any baseball teams, but he was signed by the Minnesota Twins as an amateur free agent. He was released in 1993 and spent a season playing for the unaffiliated Pocatello Posse in Idaho while bartending. After one season in Pocatello, he was signed by the Milwaukee Brewers. Due to his participation as a replacement player during the 1994 Major League Baseball strike, he was ineligible to join the Major League Baseball Players Association. In 1996, Lidle was traded to the New York Mets. Lidle made his major league debut on May 8, 1997 with the Mets.He became a trusted relief pitcher that season, going 7-1 with a 3.19 earned run average out of the bullpen. Lidle had arm surgery in 1998. Lidle later played for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Oakland Athletics, Toronto Blue Jays, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees. His best season was 2001, when he achieved a 13-6 record with a 3.59 ERA (10th in the American League) for Oakland, helping the Athletics win the wild card. In August 2002, he gave up only one run during the whole month (setting Oakland's record for consecutive innings without an earned run), won all five of his starts, and was one of the prime movers in the A's historic run of 20 straight wins. It was on this Oakland team where Lidle earned the nickname \"Snacks\", for his apparent love of \"inhaling\" junk food in the bullpen. After the 2002 season, Lidle was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays, for whom he played one season. In 2003, Lidle led the major leagues with 123 earned runs allowed and had a 5.75 ERA that was the worst among qualified starters. Lidle then signed with the Cincinnati Reds, who later traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies. Lidle played for the Phillies for parts of three seasons, amassing a record of 26-20. On July 30, 2006, Lidle was traded along with outfielder Bobby Abreu from the Philadelphia Phillies to the New York Yankees for minor league shortstop C. J. Henry, the Yankees' first round pick in the 2005 draft, along with left-handed reliever Matt Smith, minor league catcher Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez, and minor league right-hander Carlos Monasterios. After being traded, he criticized his former team, stating: \"On the days I'm pitching, it's almost a coin flip as to know if the guys behind me are going to be there to play 100 percent.\" He noted his excitement to join a Yankees team that expected to win. In his first start for the Yankees, Lidle went six innings, giving up one run on four hits en route to an 8-1 Yankee victory as part of a sweep against the Toronto Blue Jays.On August 21, 2006, he went six three-hit shutout innings, completing an improbable five-game sweep (in four days) over the then second place Boston Red Sox (who went from 1+1\u20442 games behind to 6+1\u20442 games behind). Lidle \"became known for his outspoken nature, challenging the legitimacy of Barry Bonds\u2019s home run records\" in a 2006 interview. On October 7, in his final game (Game Four of the 2006 ALDS), Lidle lasted only an inning and a third, allowing three earned runs on four hits as the Yankees lost to the Detroit Tigers, 8-3. He was criticized for telling a reporter, \"We got matched up with a team that, I think, was a little more ready to play than we were,\" which was taken by some as a jab at manager Joe Torre. For damage control, he called the radio talk show Mike and the Mad Dog and gave an extended defense of himself and the Yankees; the interview became contentious. In his major league career, Lidle had a 82-72 record with a 4.57 earned run average.<PIC> Lidle was married and had one son. He and his wife, Melanie (nee Varela), were married in 1997. Their son, Christopher Taylor Lidle, was born September 18, 2000. Lidle was a descendant of Robert Fulton, the inventor of the steamboat, as reflected in his middle name. Lidle's twin brother, Kevin, also played baseball, as a catcher and pitcher for various minor league teams between 1992 and 2002, and for an independent team in 2005. On October 11, 2006, Lidle and co-pilot/flight instructor Tyler Stanger were flying a Cirrus SR20 airplane when it crashed into the Belaire Apartments complex at 524 East 72nd Street on New York City's Upper East Side, killing them both. The plane was flying above the East River past the Queensboro Bridge toward restricted airspace. A strong wind from the east due to an incoming front caused the plane to be blown into the building as it was making a 180-degree turn.In addition to the deaths of Lidle and Stanger, 26 were injured in the accident, about half of them New York City firefighters. Lidle was the third Yankee to die in a plane crash. The prior two were catcher Thurman Munson (on August 2, 1979) and pitcher Jim Hardin (on March 9, 1991). Yankees owner George Steinbrenner described Lidle's death as a \"terrible and shocking tragedy that has stunned the entire Yankees organization\" and offered his condolences to Lidle's wife and six-year-old son.

In Brazil, he is also known as Marcelinho Para\u00edba, which refers to the state in which he was born, as a means to distinguish himself from other players also called \"Marcelinho\". He was one of the best playmakers in the Bundesliga because of his extravagant skills that include his visionary passing, abundance of tricks, and his world-class technique. Born in Campina Grande, Para\u00edba, Marcelinho Para\u00edba began his career in Campinense, where he won two league titles there. Between 1994 and 1995, he played for Santos. Two years later, however, he made his breakthrough at S\u00e3o Paulo, where he won two Paulist\u00f5es before being sold to Olympique de Marseille. He only spent a year in France, and in 2001 he returned to Brazil to play for Gr\u00eamio, where he began to experience the pinnacle of his career. At that time, Marcelinho Paraiba was called \"Marcelinho Para\u00facho\" by Gremistas, because of his passage in the team.He became champion and top scorer of the Campeonato Ga\u00facho, and champion of the Copa do Brasil, where he scored a goal in the second game in the final against Corinthians, but did not play in the league that year because before the tournament, he signed a five-year contract with Hertha BSC. Marcelinho played for Hertha from 2001 to 2006. He is ranked among the most important players in the association's history and there Marcelinho was known as a technically talented player, serving as a playmaker and leader while performing in both the midfield and forward area. In addition, he carried the responsibility of executing the free kicks, corner kicks, and penalty kicks of the club. The personal trademarks of this extravagant football player are his usually remarkable shoes and his often multicolored hair. He was capped fives times for the Brazil national football team, for which he scored once. At the beginning of the 2006\u201307 season, he arbitrarily extended his off-season vacation by nine days, which led to some slight tension with the Hertha association management. After Marcelinho had expressed himself, in the following the days, contradictory statements as to whether he wanted to remain at Hertha or not, he ended his term with them, signing a three-year contract with Turkish club Trabzonspor for approximately 2.5 million euros. In August 2008, Marcelinho Para\u00edba returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo. On 6 March 2009, Coritiba signed the forward on a free transfer until the end of the year, as Marcelinho terminated his contract with Flamengo. After the relegation of Coritiba, he re-signed for S\u00e3o Paulo on 18 December 2009. On 9 August 2010, he was loaned to Sport till the end of the 2010 season and his contract was extended to the end of the 2011 season. Marcelinho subsequently represented Sport, Boa Esporte, Fortaleza, Internacional de Lages (two stints), Joinville, Oeste, Ypiranga de Erechim Treze and Portuguesa15 days before resigning due to off-field problems. In late October 2021 he was announced as the coach of Oeirense for the 2022 season. He was sacked in February 2022, after six games of the season, following a heavy defeat. On 11 March 2022 he was announced as coach of Treze for a second time.

Casboult, a tall and solidly built player, spent much of his formative years as a ruckman and key position player. Casboult began to play TAC Cup football with the Dandenong Stingrays in 2007. He played a total of 44 games with the Stingrays; in his first two seasons, he scored only three goals, but in 2009 he was moved into a key forward role and scored 41 goals in 20 matches. Casboult was recruited by the Carlton Football Club with its third round selection in the 2010 AFL Rookie Draft (at selection 44 overall). His first month at the club was eventful. Before the 2009 Christmas break, Casboult attended the team's controversial booze cruise (the fallout from which included the suspensions of Andrew Walker, Eddie Betts and Ryan Houlihan, plus a \"please explain\" to the club from the AFL); it was widely reported in the media that, in an initiation game, Casboult was handcuffed to an unnamed senior player and forced to match him drink-for-drink until barely conscious.A few days later, on 24 December, Casboult was fortunate to walk away uninjured from in a head-on car accident: his car was struck by the car of Samir Azemi, which had jumped the median strip on the Princes Highway in Dandenong. Azemi was killed in the accident. Playing as a key forward and occasional ruckman for the club's VFL-affiliate, the Northern Blues, Casboult did not play an AFL game for Carlton in his first two seasons after being drafted, and was even on occasion dropped to the VFL reserves. A PCL injury at the start of 2012 made his chances of ever making his senior debut seem unlikely; but, only two VFL games after his return from that injury, Casboult was called into the senior team for his debut as starting ruckman in Round 17, 2012, after injuries and suspension resulted in Carlton's first three ruck choices all being unavailable for selection. Casboult won a regular place in the senior team in 2014, playing as a forward and sometimes as a back-up ruckman. Over the course of his career, he gained attention as one of the strongest contested marks in the competition. and he was a Mark of the Year finalist in 2014. Through the early part of his career, this strength in his game was offset by very poor goalkicking accuracy from set shots, returning less than 50% each season and not reliable even at close range; but after working with former Collingwood and North Melbourne full forward Saverio Rocca in 2015 and again in 2017, became one of the team's most reliable set shots. He led the team in goalkicking for the only time in his career in 2017, with a return of 34 goals, 18 behinds, and signed a two-year contract extension with the club after the season. After a 2018 season was abbreviated by injury, Casboult returned as a regular to the team in 2019 and 2020, and began playing swing key position roles in both the forwardline and backline, as well as back-up ruck.Falling out of form in 2021, Casboult played about half of the season in the senior team and was delisted at the end of the year, after 154 senior games.

First aired on 16 December 1931 as 2CO from studios in Albury, New South Wales, in 2000 the station's AM transmitter in Corowa was reallocated to ABC Riverina. The station's local programming outside of breakfast is simulcast on ABC Shepparton, while networked programming is sourced via ABC Radio Melbourne and ABC Local Radio Victoria. A tiny studio was established in the Albury Post Office building to enable its first employee, Arthur Newnham, to provide a modest offering of local programming in an on-air schedule that consisted mainly of a mix of programs relayed from the ABC's Melbourne radio stations, 3LO and 3AR. The 2CO studios later moved to various Albury locations: Temple Court in Dean Street; a large house at the corner of Dean and Thugoona streets; to Townsend Street; and then into a purpose-built studio at the corner of Olive and Wilson Streets.In October 1934, 2CO played a dramatic role in the MacRobertson Air Race from Mildenhall (near London) to Melbourne when the Netherlands KLM airliner the Uiver became lost over Albury, New South Wales after being caught in a thunderstorm. 2CO announcer Arthur Newnham appealed on air for cars to line up on the Albury racecourse to light up a makeshift runway in a bid to save the plane and its occupants. The Uiver landed safely and next morning was pulled out of the mud by locals, allowing it to fly on and win the handicap section of the international air race. In the early 1990s, 2CO was re-branded as CO-FM as it switched from the AM to the FM band, retaining this name until 2000 when it became ABC Goulburn Murray. In the late 1990s, the station relocated across the border to Wodonga, into another purpose-built premises, which remains the station's current home. In 2021, the ABC's decision to axe the local Mornings program on ABC Goulburn Murray and replace it with a statewide regional Mornings program was met with criticism from state Member for Shepparton Suzanna Sheed, independent candidate for Nicholls Rob Priestly, independent member for Indi Helen Haines and Wodonga-based senator Bridget McKenzie. Sheed described it as being \"part of a progressive denigration of services.\" Priestly said that the decision meant that voices in the local region had \"further been eroded\" arguing that \"issues in Gippsland are not the same as those in Shepparton or Echuca\". Haines described the decision to reduce local programming on ABC Goulburn Murray as \"a terrible idea\" and said she intended to raise the issue with the ABC's managing director David Anderson. Along with ABC Goulburn Murray's Mornings program, local editions which were broadcast from ABC stations at Ballarat, Bendigo, Horsham and Mildura were also axed in favour of a single statewide regional Mornings program broadcast from ABC Gippsland in Sale between 9am and 10am, which also meant that local Breakfast programs which had concluded at 10am were also shortened by an hour. The hosts of the axed local Mornings programs were redeployed as field reporters.The ABC's director of regional and local services Judith Whelan argued that the decision to replace the local Mornings programs would increase the amount of quality regional content across Victoria. Whelan said it would enable journalists to share stories more widely stating that a single Mornings program would be better resourced and have the ability to cover bigger regional themes and increase the regional coverage of arts and culture. Airing on 106.5 FM from a transmission site on Mount Baranduda near Wodonga, and from low-powered transmission sites in Bright, Corryong, Harrietville and Myrtleford, ABC Goulburn Murray broadcasts its local programs from studios located at 1 High Street Wodonga, covering parts of northern Victoria and southern New South Wales including Albury, Wodonga, Wangaratta and Benalla.

Its name is a portmanteau word combining \"cem\" from \"cement\" and \"esto\" from \"asbestos.\" A type of prefabricated home using this material came to be called cemestos. Cemesto was introduced by the Celotex Corporation in 1937. It was manufactured in the form of boards and panels that were 4 feet (1.2 m) wide, about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) thick, and 4 feet (1.2 m) to 12 feet (3.7 m) long. Each 4 feet (1.2 m) by 12 feet (3.7 m) panel weighs just 265 pounds (120 kg). Cemesto was used primarily for interior and exterior walls. The John B. Pierce Foundation and Celotex collaborated to develop a prefabrication system for building low-cost housing using cemesto panels, in which single cemesto panels were slid horizontally into light wooden frames to create walls. A prototype cemesto house was displayed at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City. The Pierce system was first used in 1941 for building employee housing at the Glenn L.Martin Aircraft Company near Baltimore, Maryland. For this development, named Aero Acres, the architecture firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed gable-roofed Cape Cod houses with dimensions of 24 feet (7.3 m) by 28 feet (8.5 m), featuring large commercial-style windows in their principal rooms. In 1941 a total of 600 homes were built at Aero Acres using this design. During World War II, when other building materials were in short supply, cemesto was used extensively in the United States. Cemesto was used to build temporary office buildings in Washington, D.C. Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill adapted the Pierce system and used cemesto panels for the designs of some 2,500 pre-fabricated homes, known by the nickname \"cemestos,\" erected in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to house Manhattan Project workers and their families. In 1942 the U.S. Farm Security Administrationbuilt 400 cemesto homes in Maryland at a site alongside Aero Acres. During the 1940s, the manufacturer of cemesto touted it as a material that would in the future make it possible to mass-produce housing at a low cost. One use of the material during the post-war era was in the late 1940s in Circle Pines, Minnesota, where cemesto panels were used in building the first homes in what was envisioned to be a cooperative housing community for people of color. The use of cemesto in Circle Pines came to be regarded as substandard construction, as the builders failed to adequately seal the joints between cemesto panels. Several prominent architects embraced cemesto as a modern material and used it in their designs. For the Bousquet-Wightman House in Houston, Texas, built in 1941, architect Donald Barthelme used cemesto panels for exterior sheathing. In 1949 Edward Durell Stone called for cemesto panels in the design of a home to be built in Armonk, New York. That same year, Charles Eames designed his Eames House, Case Study House #8, to use brightly painted and unfinished Cemesto panels in a prefabricated steel frame.Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Raymond Carlson House in Phoenix, Arizona, built in 1950, to use a structural system of wood posts and cemesto boards.

Opened in 1855 by Charles Ignatious Pfaff, the original Pfaff\u2019s was modeled after the German Rathskellers that were popular in Europe at the time. Charles Pfaff's beer cellar was located on Broadway near Bleecker Street (before 1862, Pfaff's address was given as 647 Broadway; after 1865, its location was advertised as 653 Broadway) in Greenwich Village, New York City. To enter the beer cellar\u2014which was actually a vaulted ceiling bar and restaurant\u2014its patrons had to go down a set of stairs. From the mid-1850s to the late 1860s, Pfaff\u2019s was the center of New York\u2019s revolutionary culture. As writer Allan Gurganus has said, \"Pfaff\u2019s was the Andy Warhol factory, the Studio 54, the Algonquin Round Table all rolled into one.\" Habitu\u00e9s included journalist and social critic Henry Clapp, Jr., Walt Whitman, author and actress Ada Clare, poet and actress Adah Isaacs Menken, playwright John Brougham, artist Elihu Vedder, pianist and composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk (who also had an affair with Ada Clare), actor Edwin Booth, author Fitz Hugh Ludlow, and humorist Artemus Ward. Whitman called Charlie Pfaff \"a generous German restaurateur, silent, stout, jolly,\" as well as \"the best selector of champagne in America.\" Whitman also wrote an unfinished poem about Pfaff\u2019s called \"The Two Vaults,\" which included the lines:...The vault at Pfaffs where the drinkers and laughers meet to eat and drink and carouse While on the walk immediately overhead pass the myriad feet of Broadway... Writer Fitz James O'Brien also wrote an ode to Pfaff's and to the clientele; an annotated copy of these lyrics titled At Pfaff's was pasted by Thomas Butler Gunn into his 1860 diary and can be seen at The Vault at Pfaff's website. Clapp, considered by many the \"King of Bohemia\", founded The Saturday Press as New York's answer to the Atlantic Monthly. Started as a literary magazine, The Saturday Press eventually became a countercultural zine \"with a mix of poetry, stories, radical politics, and an enthusiastic spirit of personal freedom and sexual openness. Before it folded in 1868, it published numerous poems by Whitman and a short story by Mark Twain. The Saturday Press championed Leaves of Grass, a move that many view as a significant factor in the success of the 1860 edition.\" In 1870, Charles Pfaff moved his business up to midtown. Whitman wrote about Pfaff\u2019s in Specimen Days after a visit to the restaurateur's newer location many years later: An hour\u2019s fresh stimulation, coming down ten miles of Manhattan Island by railroad and 8 o\u2019clock stage.

In that game against the Detroit Tigers, Fields hit a pinch-hit home run off Detroit's Jamie Walker. He became the third player in White Sox history to hit a home run in his first major league at-bat, joining Carlos Lee (May 7, 1999) and Miguel Olivo (September 15, 2002) as the only other White Sox to do so. Fields entered the 2007 season ranked as the second-best prospect in the White Sox organization and the 45th-best prospect in Major League Baseball by Baseball America.

On August 26, 2007, Fields made his first start in left field, though he only played 21 games at that position before being moved back to third base. Fields ended his first season as a Major Leaguer by hitting a promising.244, 23 home runs, 67 RBI, and an OPS of.788 in 100 games. His 23 home runs tied him with Bill Melton for 3rd most home runs by a White Sox player in their rookie season, Melton did that in 157 games. Fields received one third-place vote for AL Rookie of the Year. Entering spring training for the 2008 season, Fields was expected to be the starting third baseman, with Joe Crede likely traded.

Fields signed with the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan on June 28, 2011. In 40 games in Japan he hit only.202. He signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on January 4, 2012. After failing to win a spot on the Dodgers opening day roster, he was assigned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes.He played in 133 games for the Isotopes, with a.322 average with 13 homers and 71 RBI.

A Victorian Tudor-style wing was later added; the house had seven bays and wings of three bays each.In the mid-1860s, the 11th Earl of Winchilsea experienced serious financial difficulties, which eventually forced him to leave the property. On 4 December 1868 trustees appointed under the Winchilsea Estate Act (1865) entered into a contract to let Eastwell Park, together with its furnishings and effects, to the Duke of Abercorn for a period of five years. Lord Winchilsea had been obliged to vacate the property sometime prior to December 1868, and he was formally adjudged bankrupt on 5 October 1870. Eastwell was next occupied by Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second son of Queen Victoria. He lived here with his family until 1893, when he inherited the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in Germany. During that time, Queen Victoria was a frequent visitor and there are photographs of her skating on the lake. Prince Alfred's older brother, the future Edward VII, was also a visitor. In 1875, Prince Alfred's daughter Princess Marie - who later became queen of Romania - was born at the house. In her memoirs, she recalls \"beautiful Eastwell with its great gray house, its magnificent park, with its herds of deer and picturesque Highland cattle, its lake, its woods, its garden with the old cedar tree which was our fairy mansion.\" In 1884, another of Alfred's children, Princess Beatrice - who later married into the Spanish Royal Family - was also born at Eastwell. After the First World War, the Eastwell estate faced the same economic problems that also affected many other English stately homes. In the 1920s the main house was severely damaged by fire. A smaller house in a similar style was built on the same site in 1926\u20131928. After many changes, Eastwell Manor is now operated as a country house hotel. There is an indoor swimming pool and a Champneys spa, and a nine-hole golf course has been laid out in the grounds. The rest of the estate is used for farming. The distinctive structure now known as Eastwell Towers stands a mile south-south west of the manor. It was the original main gatehouse to Eastwell Park and was built in 1848th Earl of Winchilsea (1815\u20131887), his second wife Lady Elizabeth Georgiana (d. 1904, daughter of Francis Conyngham, 2nd Marquess Conyngham) as well as his only son George William Finch-Hatton, Viscount Maidstone (1852\u20131879) are buried in a simple grave in the overgrown part of the church cemetery.", "images": ["w_s602"], "tokens": 883}]}

The planet orbits its host star at a distance of 0.05 AU every four days. The mass of this planet is about one half that of Jupiter, but its radius is nearly 50% larger than Jupiter's, making the density of this planet only one quarter that of water; it is thought that some other form of heating must explain its extremely low density. WASP-15b's discovery was published on April 29, 2009. WASP-15 was first observed by the WASP-South branch of the SuperWASP project, which operates from the South African Astronomical Observatory, between May 4, 2006, and July 17, 2006. It was later observed by WASP-South from January 31, 2007, to July 17, 2007, and from January 31, 2008, to May 29, 2008. Further analysis taken from 24,943 collected data points revealed eleven full or partial transits.Follow-up observations were conducted by a European and American science team at the 1.2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, which further raised the possibility of the existence of a planet in WASP-15's orbit; use of the CORALIE spectrograph on the Euler Telescope between March 6, 2008, and July 17, 2008, revealed that the variations in radial velocity measurements were not because of an eclipsing binary star system. CORALIE and the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) revealed the spectrum of WASP-15, which was used to derive the star's characteristics. The science team studying WASP-15 found that, after running best-fit models, WASP-15's radial velocity and transit shifts were most likely due to the existence of a planet. WASP-15's planet, WASP-15b, had one of the lowest densities known amongst extrasolar planets when it was discovered. Its discovery paper was published by the American Astronomical Society on April 29, 2009, in the Astronomical Journal. WASP-15 is an F-type star located in the Hydra constellation. It is located approximately 290 parsecs (900 light years) from Earth and has an apparent magnitude of 10.9, making it invisible to the unaided eye. The star is 1.18 times more massive than the Sun, and has a radius that is 1.477 times larger than that of the Sun, making it more diffuse. WASP-15 has an effective temperature of 6300 K, and is thus hotter than the Sun, although at 3.9 billion years, it is also younger. WASP-15 has a metallicity of [Fe/H] of -0.17, which means that it has 68% of the iron found in the Sun. WASP-15b has a mass of 0.542 times Jupiter's mass and a radius that is 1.428 times Jupiter's radius. Due in part to its proximity to its host star, a distance of 0.0499 AU (7,500,000 km), WASP-15b is greatly inflated, with a density of 0.247 g/cm3. Another factor, such as an internal heat source, is suspected to add to this extremely high radius and extremely low density. WASP-15b orbits its host star every 3.7520656 days. It also has an orbital inclination of 85.5o, making it almost edge-on as seen from the Earth's perspective.The study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, have determined the planetary orbit is strongly misaligned with the equatorial plane of the star, misalignment equal to -139.6+4.3 \u22125.2\u00b0. This spin-orbit angle is making orbit of WASP-15b retrograde.<PIC> In 2019 the IAU announced as part of NameExoWorlds that WASP-15 and its planet WASP-15b would be given official names chosen by school children from The Ivory Coast.", "images": ["w_s609"], "tokens": 895}]}

SN 2008ha was unusual in several ways: with an absolute V band magnitude of \u221214.2 it is one of the faintest supernovae ever observed; its host galaxy type very rarely produces supernovae. Another unusual feature of SN 2008ha was its low expansion velocity of only ~2000 km/s at maximum brightness, which indicates a very small kinetic energy released in the explosion. For comparison, SN 2002cx expanded at a velocity of ~5000 km/s whereas typical SN Ia expand at around ~10,000 km/s. The low expansion velocity of SN2008ha resulted in relatively small Doppler broadening of spectral emission lines and this led to higher quality data. The supernova was studied with ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometry as well as optical spectra, using the Magellan telescopes in Chile, the MMT telescope in Arizona, the Gemini and Keck telescopes in Hawaii, and NASA's Swift satellite.Spectroscopically, SN 2008ha was identified as a SN 2002cx-type, a peculiar sub-class of SN Ia. SN 2008ha had a brightness period of only 10 days, which is significantly shorter than that of other SN 2002cx-like objects (~15 days) or normal Ia supernovas (~20 days). From the peak luminosity and the brightness time it was estimated that SN 2008ha generated (3.0 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 of 56Ni, had a kinetic energy of 2 \u00d7 1048 ergs, and ejected 0.15 M\u2299 of material.<PIC> SN 2008ha was co-discovered by Caroline Moore, Jack Newton and Tim Puckett, members of the Puckett Observatory World Supernova Search. The 14-year-old Moore received considerable attention for her role in the discovery because at the time, she was the youngest person to have discovered a supernova. Moore is currently majoring in Political Science at Georgetown University. She was born and raised in Warwick, NY. To make the discovery shDespite being one of the weakest observed supernova on record, it was up to 1000 times brighter than the sun at one point and is approximately 70 million light years away from earth. Some scientists suggested that the supernova may have failed in exploding completely which is why the light emitted from it is so weak compared to other supernovas. In reference to Moore, one astrophysicist remarked that \"the youngest person to ever discover a supernova found one of the most peculiar and interesting supernovae ever.\" President of the United States Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama met with Moore after her discovery.", "images": ["w_s624"], "tokens": 656}]}

His Syriac name (from \u02bfAmm\u0101n\u016b\u0113l) may denote that he was Aramaic in origin. However, a Parthian origin may also be seen and is mentioned by some scholars, especially due to his outstanding role in establishing the Parthian language as the official language of the eastern Manichean Church, later to be replaced by Sogdian in the sixth century. Furthermore, Mar Ammo is widely regarded as the composer of the Manichaean Parthian hymn-cycles (Huw\u012bdagm\u0101n and Angad R\u014d\u0161nan). On his way to eastern Iran, Mar Ammo was accompanied by the Parthian prince Ardavan. According to Manichaean tradition, when he reached the river Oxus on the Sogdian frontier the spirit who guarded it denied Mar Ammo entry across it.Mar Ammo fasted and prayed for two days and he either was confronted by Mani or had a vision of him who told him to read a chapter from his book The Treasury of Life which is generally believed to be a component of the Manichaean canon. When the spirit returned she asked why he was on a journey he responded that he wished to teach fasting and absentation from wine, flesh and woman. The spirit responded that there were similar men in her lands perhaps referring to Buddhists in Sogdiana. However, when Mar Ammo read from one of Mani's books she realized he was a bringer of the \"true religion\" and allowed him to pass. The spirit can be identified with the goddess Ardvakhsh who has associations with the river. However fragmentary texts from Turpan tell a slightly different story in which Mani himself encounters the frontier spirit. Because of Mar Ammo, Manichaeism became established in Sogdiana. He was also closely associated with Mani. Mani also spent his last hours of his life with Mar Ammo whom he called \"his dearest son\". Following the death of Mani in 276 CE, at the command of the Sassanid King Bahram I, Sogdiana became home to a large Manichaean Community. This was dually because of the work of Mar Ammo and the eastward migrations of Manichaeans due to their persecution in Persia. Although Manichaeism was a fairly unified religious phenomenon, three hundred years after the death of Mar Ammo there was a schism between the Manichaean church in Babylonia and the Sogdian Manichaeans. The Sogdian Manichaeans, known as the Denawars (Middle Persian D\u0113nawar), viewed Mar Ammo as the founder of their sect and called themselves the \"Pure Ones\". However, another head of the Manichaean community, Shad Ohrmazd, is mentioned as the actual founder of the Denawari School (D\u012bn\u0101var\u012bya). The rift between the eastern and western Manichaeans was not caused by any doctrinal matters. The capital of the sect by the 8th century was centered in Kocho, on the northern Silk road. At the time it was at least active from Samarkand to Chang'an.The schism between the eastern and western churches was worked out and ended by the eighth century. Manichaeism, following its introduction into Sogdiana, would be spread in part by Sogdians eastward into the Tarim basin and China. Manichaeism would last at least for another six hundred years, fading away after the fourteenth century.<PIC>", "images": ["w_s629"], "tokens": 862}]}

It was discovered on 17 June 1909, by German astronomer August Kopff at the Heidelberg-K\u00f6nigstuhl State Observatory. The presumed S-type asteroid has a short rotation period of 4.9 hours and measures approximately 19 kilometers (12 miles) in diameter. Possibly inspired by the asteroid's provisional designation \"1909 HA\", it was named for the biblical woman Hagar. When applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements, Hagar is a core member of the Eunomia family (502), a prominent family of stony S-type asteroids and the largest one in the intermediate main belt with more than 5,000 known members. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.2\u20133.1 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,579 days; semi-major axis of 2.65 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 12\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Vienna Observatory on 28 June 1909, just eleven nights after prior to its official discovery observation by August Kopff at Heidelberg.This minor planet was named after the biblical woman Hagar from the Book of Genesis. She was an Ancient Egyptian servant of Sarah and the mother of Abraham's firstborn, Ishmael. The asteroid's name may have been inspired by the two letters of its provisional designation, \"1909 HA\". It is also speculated that the name comes from a list created in 1913 by the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) containing suggestions of female names from history and mythology for the naming of minor planets (AN 196, 137). At the time, the naming process was not well developed and the ARI feared inconsistencies and potential confusion. The list was sent to several German astronomers, including Kopff, with the invitation to name all of their made discoveries up to number 700. Based on the overall spectral type of the Eunomia family, Hagar is possibly a common, stony S-type asteroid. However, observations by Pilcher (see below) found a V\u2013R color index of 0.400\u00b10.040, which rather suggest a low albedo of a carbonaceous C-type asteroid. In August 2013, a rotational lightcurve of Hagar was obtained from nine nights of photometric observations by Frederick Pilcher at the Organ Mesa Observatory (G50) in Arizona. Analysis gave a well-defined, classically shaped bimodal lightcurve with a rotation period of (4.8503\u00b10.0001) hours and a high brightness variation of 0.52\u00b10.03 magnitude (U=3). At the same time, Alexander Kurtenkov at Sofia University, and a team of Bulgarian students obtained a concurring period of 4.854\u00b10.011 hours with an amplitude of 0.49\u00b10.03 magnitude (U=3). In July 2017, French and Swiss astronomers Ren\u00e9 Roy and Raoul Behrend confirmed the period measuring a nearly identical rotation of (4.8516\u00b10.0003) hours and an amplitude of 0.51\u00b10.02 magnitude (U=3).<PIC> Two lightcurves, published in 2016, using modeled photometric data from the Lowell Photometric Database (LPD) and other sources, gave a concurring sidereal period of (4.850417\u00b10.000001) and (4.85042\u00b10.00005) hours, respectively. Each modeled lightcurve also determined two spin axes of (93.0\u00b0, \u221271.0\u00b0) and (277.0\u00b0, \u221235.0\u00b0), as well as (56.0\u00b0, \u221278.0\u00b0) and (255.0\u00b0, \u221257.0\u00b0) in ecliptic coordinates (\u03bb, \u03b2), respectively. American photometrist Frederick Pilcher also determined a diameter of 19\u00b14 kilometers based on a visual absolute magnitude of 12.27\u00b10.07, and an albedo of 0.057 derived from its measured V\u2013R color index (see above).

The most important influences on his thought were Spinoza, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger and Michel Foucault. Paquet rejected all forms of Idealism in favor of the sensory world. Insofar as he considered human beings to be no more than fragments of nature, thought was considered by him to be the result of cerebral processes which operate largely beneath the level of consciousness. He insisted on the pre-eminence of the body and the fact that, for this reasons, consciousness observes the results of thought, but does not bring them into being. Inspired by Nietzsche's notion of Eternal Recurrence - which Paquet treated not as a doctrine but an operational principle, that is as a means of disentangling ourselves from secondary aspects of our identity (determined by cultural, religious and moral factors) in order to recover our primary nature - he considered a return to the body as the sole ethical value.He developed this Spinozan theme in a number of different directions: ontology (L'enjeu de la philosophie, Platon: l\u2019\u00e9ternel retour de la libert\u00e9), political philosophy (Nous autres Europ\u00e9ens, Le Fascisme Blanc) and esthetics, the latter in particular in relation to painting which he defined as the art of rendering the sensory visible. He is the author of a large number of essays consecrated to visual artists whom he knew personally: Jean Dubuffet, Alexander Calder, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Paul Delvaux, Fernando Botero, Sophia Vari, Corneille (one of the six founders of the Cobra movement), Bram Bogart, Anna Wilczynska-Wilska, Amann.

The woody stem bases emerge from a big taproot, and as they age the bark comes off in strips or plates. The upper branches are hairless or tufted with bits of hair. There are solitary leaves widely spaced on the branches. They are lance-shaped, no more than 1.5 centimeters long, and hairy on the undersides. The inflorescence is a small, dense cyme of flowers 2 or 3 centimeters long and packed with tiny whitish or cream-colored flowers.The area lies within the Uncompahgre River Valley, which hosts agricultural operations fed by a number of canals and ditches. These have access roads. The construction and maintenance of the canals and roads create disturbance in the habitat and help introduce invasive plants to the area. Sediment scooped from the canals is dumped in the plant's habitat. About 40% of the plant's total habitat is affected by these activities. Off-road vehicle use damages the landscape by compacting and eroding soil, creating dust, fragmenting the habitat, and crushing individual plants. The adobe clay substrate is easily broken and eroded because it is bare and contains few plant roots to hold it together.

The original main house was constructed of logs but has since been weatherboarded. This three bay, weatherboarded house, elevated on flat bedrock, has a trabeated doorway with side lights. Its double verandah has square posts with flat bannisters that still remain on the upper porch. Around the gable edges is also a flat, scalloped wood trim. Originally there were no glazed windows, only shutters. Off the central hall, with its set of narrow stairs, are two larger rooms. The room on the right has a simple, delicately designed mantel on the rear wall; horizontal panelling boards in this room average about a foot in width.The room on the left does not have the original panelling, but a heavy mantel with the curved inset is an early mantel style. Upstairs, there apparently was only one finished room, the other area of which has no flooring or windows, and apparently was never used. Probably a later addition of about 1870 is the one story, three bay \"cottage\" adjoined on the rear, its square columned porch with plain bannisters faces east. To the rear of this two room addition and to that of the main portion of the house is a continuous L-shaped shed porch. Part of the shed porch has been converted into a room on the rear of the main house portion. One Stone chimney, original to the 1818 house, is on the west side of the house; another later chimney on the rear wall of the right room was probably added at the same time as the \"cottage\" portion. A well house, several barns and a grape arbor are also on the property. Originally there was a covered oak-boarded walkway to the rear of the house, where the grape arbor is now, that led to a building that housed a kitchen, dining room and an upstairs bunkroom for the boys. The Bowman-Pirkle House, a two story log plantation plain type house; is significantly known to have been built by John Bowman with the help of Cherokee Indians in 1818 during a transition period when this area was being ceded to the U.S. government by the Cherokees. Important persons, including Andrew Jackson and Major Ridge, a Chief of the Cherokee Nation, visited in this house during Bowman's ownership and that of its later owner, Noah Pirkle. The house with few changes remained in the Pirkle family until 1969, at which time it was given to the Hall County Historical Society. John Bowman, the builder of the Bowman-Pirkle House came to North Georgia when he was a volunteer courier for General Andrew Jackson's staff. In 1818 General Jackson rested his troops at the old \"Young Tavern\" [Robert Young Inn] above Flowery Branch, Georgia, en route to the Seminole Campaign.While here John Bowman visited Major Ridge, one of the Chiefs of the Cherokees who was holding an encampment nearby. At the end of this visit, Major Ridge gave John Bowman a sizable tract of land. Bowman detached himself from the General's staff and with the aid of Cherokee braves, built the two story log house in which he resided from 1818 to 1890. In about 1822, Bowman married Mary Smith of North Carolina, the same state in which he was born April 17, 1798. The title of \"Doctor\", Bowman earned by learning from the Indians herbal medicine; he planted these herbs by a stream about a mile from his house which came to be called \"medicine hollow.\" He treated both Indians and whites and was well respected in this field. During his lifetime, Dr. Bowman also developed a large and practically self-sufficient plantation. Bowman's daughter, Amanda, married Noah Pirkle in 1867. Noah Pirkle served in the Confederate Army, Co. \"A\", llth Georgia Regiment under Captain Bedell. When Sherman burned Atlanta, General John Brown Gordon sent some men to defend Athens. Their efforts kept the Federal troops from burning Athens. For three days the Federal troops attempted to cross the East Branch of the Oconee River. They suffered heavy casualties and decided to retreat. Noah Pirkle was one of the defending Confederate soldiers. They surrounded a large group of Federal troops, marched them for three days and then rested at the old John Bowman place. They placed the prisoners in the horse lot there. Seventeen men, including Pirkle, were drawn to do sentiel duty. Early the next morning Bowman invited these men in for breakfast. At the end of the meal, Pirkle looked at Amanda Pirkle who was helping to serve the table and said, \"You are beautiful, if I am still alive when the War is over, I am going to come back and marry you.\" He kept his promise. At John Bowman's death in 1890, Pirkle purchased a portion of the plantation which included the house. The house was passed through the Pirkle family until 1969.The Bowman-Pirkle House is a fine example of the architecture of the early settlement of Indian lands. This area of Hall County was ceded by the Cherokees officially July 8, 1817, resulting in Bowman having to buy back 1818 land grants issued by Gov. George Troup. (Three of these land grants 250 acre tracts, selling for twelve to eighteen dollars each, are still among the Pirkle family papers.) Thus, this house is probably one of the earliest structures built and occupied by whites in this Indian territory. Presently the house is located on Friendship Road; but now owned by the Hall County Historical Society. It will be moved to a location inside the city limits of Gainesville on Queen City Parkway just off of Hwy. 360, Exit 5 and replaced in a farm setting adjacent to a state approved welcome center. As directed by the State Review Board, the Bowman-Pirkle House is being nominated based on its present appearance and siting. After the structure's removal and restoration, the Board will reconsider the structure in the light of changes which may affect its qualifications as a National Register property.\" -National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form for Bowman-Pirkle House, 14 Aug 1973<PIC> As of 1861, 10 victims of slavery were captive on the Bowman plantation.

{"id": 30205, "dataset": "wiki", "images": ["w_s1334"], "chunks": [{"chunk_id": 1, "text": "Kristen Richards (born July 4, 1992) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player. She is currently a member of the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association (PWHPA), following four seasons with the Markham Thunder (formerly the Brampton Thunder) of the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL). Prior to that, she played NCAA Division I hockey for Niagara and Robert Morris. Richards skated for the Mississauga Jr. Chiefs of the Provincial Women's Hockey League (PWHL), serving as the team's captain in 2009\u201310, when she posted 47 points in 33 games. The Chiefs were one of the top programs in both the PWHL and the Ontario Women's Hockey Association (OWHA) with Richards on the team, winning the OWHA's gold medal to conclude the 2008\u201309 season. Additionally, Mississauga enjoyed top-three finishes in the league or association in 2007\u201308 (bronze medals for both the PWHL and OWHA) and 2009\u201310 (PWHL silver medal, OWHA bronze medal). Notably, Richards' Chiefs teams included future Thunder teammate Sarah Edney, future Robert Morris teammate Thea Imbrogno, and other future NCAA and professional players like Emily Pfalzer and Jenna Dingeldein.In addition to the Chiefs, Richards also attended St. Basil-the-Great College School and enjoyed success with her school team, winning Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations championships in 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310, as well as four Toronto District College Athletic Association titles. Richards signed with Niagara University to begin her collegiate career and made an immediate impact at NU, scoring seven times and adding seven assists as a freshman to tie for second on the team in scoring. Her first college goal (and point) came against Minnesota State on October 8, 2010, although her third goal one month later was among her biggest: Richards' overtime power play goal with 1:59 remaining toppled Mercyhurst at Dwyer Arena. The Lakers were ranked fourth in NCAA Division I at the time and were coming off of an appearance in the 2010Frozen Four. Six days later, on November 12, 2010, Richards scored with 3:56 remaining to defeat Colgate, while her first multi-point game involved a pair of assists in a 2\u20131 victory over Wayne State on January 15, 2011. On a team level, the Purple Eagles' 2010\u201311 season got off to a slow start, as NU was just 3\u201312\u20133 in early December. Things turned around a little from there, as subsequent unbeaten streaks of six games and four games helped Niagara finish second in the College Hockey America (CHA) standings with an 8\u20136\u20130 league record. However, third-seeded Syracuse abruptly ended the Purple Eagles' season in the CHA semifinals. Richards, for her part, was selected to the CHA's all-rookie team in recognition of her strong freshman season. For the 2011\u201312 season, Niagara changed coaches, with assistant Josh Sciba promoted to replace the departed Chris MacKenzie. Meanwhile, Richards had quickly become considered a central part of the young team's offense, along with Jessica Hitchcock and Jenna Hendrikx.Although the Purple Eagles started the year 0\u20134\u20130, things abruptly turned around on October 14, 2011 against RPI, when Richards scored twice - the second coming on a penalty shot in overtime after she was hooked on a breakaway - to help NU to its first win of the year and the first win of Sciba's head coaching career. The come-from-behind effort set off a hot streak, as Niagara went 7\u20132\u20135 over a 14-game span to climb to 7\u20136\u20135 overall after a tie with Ohio State on December 2, 2011. While that turned out to be the pinnacle of NU's campaign - the Purps finished the regular season 10\u201315\u20138 overall and a third-place-worthy 3\u20136\u20133 within the CHA - Richards continued to demonstrate an aptitude for big, dramatic goals. On January 21, 2012 at Syracuse, she banged home a 5-on-3 advantage tally late in overtime to beat the Orange by a 2\u20131 count. Two weeks later, at Mercyhurst, Niagara found itself facing third-period deficits of 2\u20131 and 3\u20132, but Richards answered each time, the latter with just 12 seconds remaining, to force a draw with the fifth-ranked Lakers. In the 2012 CHA playoffs, Niagara again saw its run come to a quick end in the semifinals, this time to a Robert Morris team en route to its first-ever conference title. Richards qualified for the All-CHA Academic Team for the second season in a row. Shortly after the conclusion of the 2011\u201312 season, Niagara announced that it would immediately discontinue its women's hockey program, forcing Richards and other members of the team to either transfer or continue studying at NU without playing hockey. For Richards, along with defenseman Kelsey Gunn, the solution to the Niagara situation was a move south to newly crowned CHA champion Robert Morris, a transfer that paid nearly-immediate dividends. In her first official NCAA game as a Colonial (following a handful of exhibition contests), Richards scored the game-winning goal in a 2\u20130 victory over Yale. Not only that, but in a sort of a full-circle moment, it was assisted off of a turnover by Imbrogno, Richards' old teammate from St. Basil's and the Mississauga Jr. Chiefs.Despite playing 10 of its first 12 games on the road, RMU got off to a 9\u20133\u20132 start in 2012\u201313, following a sweep of Mercyhurst upon returning home. Along the way, Richards showed that she didn't leave her knack for late-game heroics at Niagara, as she deflected home a third-period goal to force overtime at Vermont on November 4, 2012, then fed Anneline Lauziere for the winner. RMU slumped badly after New Year's however, going just 2\u201311\u20131 in 2013 before a regular-season-ending sweep of NCAA newcomer Penn State salvaged a 13\u201314\u20133 overall record and a fourth-place finish in a tight CHA race. Richards' late season was highlighted by her hand in both Robert Morris goals (along with a third-period checking from behind major and game misconduct) in a tie with RIT on January 26, 2013 as well as two other multi-point efforts. The Colonials opened the 2013 CHA playoffs with a first-round series sweep over fifth-seeded Lindenwood, but fell to Mercyhurst in the conference semifinals to close the year. After the unsuccessful CHA title defense, expectations were somewhat tempered for RMU in Richards' senior year, 2013\u201314, as the conference coaches tabbed the Colonials third in the preseason poll, although Richards - now the team's captain - was again expected to play a key role. Both team and individual rose to the challenge however, with Robert Morris' 24\u20138\u20133 final overall mark standing as the best in program history to that point (the 24 wins remain tied for the team record as of the end of 2016\u201317) and Richards depositing a career-best 26 points in those 35 games. RMU's 13\u20135\u20132 CHA record narrowly missed the school's first league regular-season title, as the Colonials were second to archrival Mercyhurst by four points. Richards' season was highlighted by her being named the CHA's Offensive Player of the Week on November 4, 2013, following a weekend sweep at Penn State, where she scored twice on 11 shots (of RMU's 49 total) in the second game of the series.She handed out three assists (a career-best for points) in a 6\u20134 win over Vermont on October 26, 2013, with that game and the Penn State games capping a career-best seven-game point streak. She would later add a five-game streak from November 26, 2013 against Ohio State through January 4, 2014 versus St. Lawrence. Against Syracuse on February 7, 2014, Richards and Imbrogno both assisted on a Brittany Howard goal that gave Imbrogno Robert Morris' career assist record. In a bit of a parallel to the end of her time at Niagara, Richards' RMU and college career came to a close in the CHA semifinals at the hands of a team en route to a surprising championship run, in this case an RIT squad that was 16\u201315\u20133 overall during the regular season. As of the end of the 2016\u201317 season, Richards' name remains a prominent part of the Colonials' record books, despite only playing two seasons at the school. Among other listings, she is sixth in team history in points per game (0.73), fourth in plus-minus rating (plus-17) and her 15 shots against Lindenwood on March 1, 2013 are an RMU single-game high. Richards entered the CWHL in 2015, when she was selected by the then-Brampton Thunder in the that year's CWHL Draft with the 16th overall pick, first in the fourth round (notably, former RMU teammate Rebecca Vint had also been selected by the Thunder with their previous selection, 11th overall, while former Mississauga Jr. Chiefs teammate Edney, who went on to play collegiate hockey at Harvard was drafted first overall by Brampton). The 2015\u201316 season saw a resurgence for the Thunder, one of professional women's hockey's most storied franchises, but also one that had fallen on hard times with a 6\u201316\u20132 record in 2014\u201315 and a last-place league finish. Richards' new squad would rebound to 16\u20137\u20131, good for third place in the league standings and a playoff semifinal series with the second-seeded Calgary Inferno, although the Inferno swept the best-of-three round on the way to the 2016 Clarkson Cup.Richards scored her first professional goal on November 21, 2015 in a rout of the Boston Blades, while adding a shorthanded assist on the way to a 13-point season, good for eighth best on the Thunder. She also rapidly gained a reputation as one of the CWHL's most dangerous penalty killers. Brampton led the league with seven shorthanded goals (and was second with an 83.19 percent penalty kill rate), while Richards' three shorthanded points were tied for the best league-wide (with Caroline Ouellette, Marie-Philip Poulin and Cathy Chartrand). She also offered eight points over four consecutive January 2016 games including, arguably, the Thunder's biggest results of the year, a sweep of the Inferno via overtime and shootout wins at Brampton Memorial Arena on the 9th and 10th. Richards scored in the first game while setting up Candice Styles' OT winner, then had three assists the next day in a wild 8\u20137 shootout victory that saw Brampton rally from numerous large deficits, including 5\u20131 early in the second period and 7\u20135 midway through the third. In 2016\u201317, the Thunder slid slightly backwards to 12\u201310\u20132, but were a carbon copy of their 2015\u201316 version in many other ways: the team finished third in the league standings, and was defeated in a playoff semifinal sweep to the eventual Clarkson Cup champion, this time Les Canadiennes de Montreal. Richards played in her 50th professional game (including playoff contests) in the regular-season finale, a shootout win over Boston on February 19, 2017.<PIC> Richards was an accomplished ball hockey player, in addition to her ice hockey exploits, at St. Basil-the-Great College. St. Basil's won the Ontario Ball Hockey Association's provincial championships in 2007, 2008 and again in 2010, with Richards earning a spot on the tournament all-star team during the 2010 run. In 2015, along with future Thunder teammates Vint and Jamie Lee Rattray, Richards competed at the Canadian Ball Hockey Association national championships and helped the Toronto Shamrocks to the title. She collected an assist in the final, a 2\u20131 overtime win over Newfoundland United.Richards has credited her experience at the CBHA tournament for helping her transition to CWHL play, after taking 2014\u201315 off following her graduation from Robert Morris. Richards holds an English degree from Robert Morris University and is a certified English, special education, and ESL teacher. She is a member of the staff at De La Sale College, a private school in Toronto, Ontario that emphasizes athletics. She has also served as the head development coach of the Etobicoke Dolphins Girls Hockey Association, specializing in power skating. 2010\u201311 CHA All-Rookie Team 2010\u201311 CHA All-Academic Team 2011\u201312 CHA All-Academic Team 2012\u201313 CHA All-Academic Team 2013\u201314 CHA All-Academic Team CHA Offensive Player of the Week (November 4, 2013)", "images": ["w_s1334"], "tokens": 3011}]}

{"id": 30207, "dataset": "wiki", "images": ["w_s1336"], "chunks": [{"chunk_id": 1, "text": "In mathematics, Cramer's paradox or the Cramer\u2013Euler paradox is the statement that the number of points of intersection of two higher-order curves in the plane can be greater than the number of arbitrary points that are usually needed to define one such curve. It is named after the Genevan mathematician Gabriel Cramer. This phenomenon appears paradoxical because the points of intersection fail to uniquely define any curve (they belong to at least two different curves) despite their large number. It is the result of a naive understanding or a misapplication of two theorems: B\u00e9zout's theorem states that the number of points of intersection of two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, provided that certain necessary conditions are met. In particular, two curves of degree n generally have n^{2} points of intersection. Cramer's theorem states that a curve of degree n is determined by {\\displaystyle n(n+3)/2} points, again assuming that certain conditions hold.For all n\\geq 3, {\\displaystyle n^{2}\\geq n(n+3)/2}, so it would naively appear that for degree three or higher, the intersection of two curves would have enough points to define either of the curves uniquely. However, because these points belong to both curves, they do not define a unique curve of this degree. The resolution of the paradox is that the {\\displaystyle n(n+3)/2} bound on the number of points needed to define a curve only applies to points in general position. In certain degenerate cases, {\\displaystyle n(n+3)/2} points are not enough to determine a curve uniquely. The paradox was first published by Colin Maclaurin. Cramer and Leonhard Euler corresponded on the paradox in letters of 1744 and 1745 and Euler explained the problem to Cramer. It has become known as Cramer's paradox after featuring in his 1750 book Introduction \u00e0 l'analyse des lignes courbes alg\u00e9briques, although Cramer quoted Maclaurin as the source of the statement. At about the same time, Euler published examples showing a cubic curve which was not uniquely defined by 9 points and discussed the problem in his book Introductio in analysin infinitorum. The result was publicized by James Stirling and explained by Julius Pl\u00fccker. For first order curves (that is lines) the paradox does not occur, because n=1, so {\\displaystyle n^{2}=1<n(n+3)/2=2}. In general two distinct lines intersect at a single point unless the lines are of equal slope, in which case they do not intersect at all. A single point is not sufficient to define a line (two are needed); through the point of intersection there pass not only the two given lines but an infinite number of other lines as well. Two nondegenerate conics intersect in at most at four finite points in the real plane, which is fewer than the nine given as a maximum by B\u00e9zout's theorem. However, five points are needed to define a nondegenerate conic, so again in this case there is no paradox. In a letter to Euler, Cramer pointed out that the cubic curves x^{3}-x=0 and {\\displaystyle y^{3}-y=0} intersect in precisely nine points.The first equation defines three vertical lines x=-1, x=0, and x=1, and similarly the second equation defines three horizontal lines; these lines intersect in a grid of nine points. Hence nine points are not sufficient to uniquely determine a cubic curve in degenerate cases such as these.<PIC> A bivariate equation of degree n has 1 + n(n + 3) / 2 coefficients, but the set of points described by the equation is preserved if the equation is divided through by one of the coefficients, leaving one coefficient equal to 1 and only n(n + 3) / 2 coefficients to characterize the curve. Given n(n + 3) / 2 points (xi, yi), each of these points can be used to create a separate equation by substituting it into the general polynomial equation of degree n, giving n(n + 3) / 2 equations linear in the n(n + 3) / 2 unknown coefficients. If this system is non-degenerate in the sense of having a non-zero determinant, the unknown coefficients are uniquely determined and hence the polynomial equation and its curve are uniquely determined. But if this determinant is zero, the system is degenerate and the points can be on more than one curve of degree n.", "images": ["w_s1336"], "tokens": 1114}]}

It was built from 1902 to c. 1926. It is also known as Stannary Hills Mill. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 December 2002. Tin was discovered in the Rocky Bluff district in 1883 but initially little development occurred. Extensive leases were acquired over the area by a South Australian company, the North Queensland Tin Mining Corporation, in 1900. The company passed the properties and fixed assets to the Stannary Hills Mines and Tramway Company Limited, an Adelaide-based company with a nominated capital of \u00a3650,000. This company took advantage of the tramway clause in the Mining Act of 1898 and commenced surveys for a narrow gauge tramway from Boonmoo, along Eureka Creek to Stannary Hills, thence over the ridge to a terminus at Watsonville. The line opened to Stannary Hills in May 1902. Instead of proceeding to Watsonville it was decided to construct a branch line 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) to Rocky Bluff on the Walsh River and this opened on 18 November 1902. The battery was constructed in 1902 on a machine area of 4 hectares beside the Walsh River.Sand and gravel had to be carted uphill from the river. Bricks were carted in on the Stannary Hills tramway and then lowered on a rope tramway 190 metres (620 ft) down the hill to the battery site. The battery was formally opened on 6 May 1903. Named \"Jumping Moses\", the 20 head battery, Huntington mill and Merton furnace were perched high on the steep hillside above the river. The battery closed in June 1903 because the mortar box shifted and there was insufficient boiler power. The general manager, Charles S. Pasley, reported that the battery could only work at half power until the boiler was replaced by a larger one; \u00a3600 was to be spent on two frue vanners, two wheeler pans and a small four compartment jigger. In 1905 new stamper foundations and storage bins were constructed, a further 10 head stamps were added and the old 20 head were replaced. New rolls were put in between rockbreaker and battery, and a travelling \"grizzly\" to take the crushed ore with the roughs taken out on a moving elevator. A Krupp ball mill reground the coarser parts of the battery pulp. All the pumps were replaced by new return pumps throughout the mill. The bases of the vanners were built in and the brickwork of the Merton furnace was repaired and relined. A slime buddle was also put in to deal more efficiently with the overflow slimes. The gravitation water supply was brought by wooden fluming about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) up the river, except at times of reduced flow, when a system of pumping from, and returning to a dam in the river was resorted to. Motive power for the battery was supplied by a 350 hp Robey compound engine and for the dressing plant by a 30 hp high- pressure engine, steam being generated in Babcock and Wilcox boilers. In 1905 the small township of Rocky Bluffs had \"some 200 inhabitants and... a good hotel, store and provisional school\". The battery supplied electricity to the school and some of the principal buildings in the township.The township was also reticulated from the gravitational water supply. Because of its steep site the township had the reputation that no wheeled vehicle, cart, wagon or buggy ever got into its main streets. A postal receiving office operated from 1903 to 1907. The battery and general work at Rocky Bluffs, the terminus of the Stannary Hills tramline, gave employment to about 50 men in 1905. Ore was shipped in from surrounding mines, such as the Arbouin, which was connected by an aerial ropeway to the tramline, the Ivanhoe, Extended, Kitchener and Eclipse mines. The Stannary Hills Company spent \u00a3120,000 in three years on tramways, plant and buildings, and mine development. The company was highly successful while tin prices remained high, but after the collapse of the market in late 1907 its influence declined. Between 1904 and 1911, when the company closed down output was valued at \u00a3275,352. John Darling and Company, a South Australian company, bought the assets of the liquidated Stannary Hills Tramway and Tin Mines Limited and undertook extensive repairs in 1912 to reopen the battery. The battery was renovated in 1917. It reopened with one shift per day in the latter half of 1918 and operated into the mid 1920s. The tramway from the Junction to Rocky Bluff was dismantled in 1926. The place comprises a number of components including the formation and terminus structures of the Stannary Hills - Rocky Bluff tramway: a ropeway formation descending from the tramway to the battery including concrete brake mounts; and foundations of the battery including terraced benches and high retaining walls descending steeply to the Walsh River; an intact stone weir across the river; and two township areas, one on the river flat and the other in the gully below the battery. The battery comprises four main terraced levels separated with high rock-face retaining walls.The crusher level includes sections of brick walls and flues of a two-unit Babcock boiler house, the substantial brick base of a metal chimney and concrete engine mounts. Adjacent are three pairs of concrete foundations for 30 head of stamps. The battery floor contains three circular brick bases for large agitator vats, and an intact square brick chimney associated with an arrangement of brick precipitation tanks. A furnace floor, below, contains the brick remains of a Merton furnace with flues connecting to the base of the chimney. This area also contains a small retort consisting of an iron furnace and brick firebox. Three circular concrete rendered brick buddle bases for the treatment of slimes are located on a lower level. Evidence of structures at the settlement sites is minimal and includes timber stumps, rock walls and a dump of green beer bottles marking a hotel or store site. A section of steel chimney has been dumped on the settlement site. A small stone building survives in the vicinity of the settlement. Rocky Bluff Battery and Township was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 December 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Rocky Bluff battery, tramway and township are significant as an expression of early integrated development in North Queensland's mining industry. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The combination of functions in one place is unique: steam tramway and terminus, rope incline tramway, battery, weir and settlement. The battery of 30 head was one of the largest to operate in the Mareeba district. The brick chimney and Merton furnace (though partly demolished), are a rare combination. The place is one of the few battery sites in Queensland with a brick chimney remaining. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Due to difficult access the place retains comprehensive evidence of the layout of a range of representative late 19th century haulage, concentrating and settlement features.The battery layout still clearly demonstrates treatment processes through its surviving structures and surface archaeology. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The battery site was selected for efficient operation above the Walsh River and the mountain and river setting is very impressive containing historic landscape values.<PIC>", "images": ["w_s1343"], "tokens": 1820}]}

Since 1 January 2016, it is part of Essarts-en-Bocage. The town of Les Essarts is located between the A83 and the A87 freeways, between La Roche sur Yon and Les Herbiers, 55 km from les Sables d'Olonne and 30 km from Le Puy du Fou. The city was built at the Roman period. At the Middle Ages, there was a lord in the middle of the town, and a fort was built. During the war in the Vend\u00e9e, on 25 June 1795, a battle took place in the Les Essarts fort. Charette hired Louis Pageot, one of his lieutenants, to surprise the garrison of Les Essarts. 300 republicans were caught, and then shot after the execution of 748 chouans. During World War II, Germans occupied the Moulin de l'Ansonni\u00e8re. In 2008, Les Essarts counted 4946 inhabitants (an 18% raise comparing to 1999). In 1800, date people started to record the number of inhabitants there, there was 1844 inhabitants in the town.The Old Castle : The story of the castle starts at the Roman period, according to research made in 1935, which led to the creation of a \u00ab Suovetaurilia \u00bb : a sacrificial altar dedicated to March. Then, the first fort in Les Essarts (a wooden castle) was made at the feudal period. Starting from the 18th century, lords living around started to build a castle in stone. During the war in the Vend\u00e9e (1793\u20131796, counterrevolution in the Vend\u00e9e region of France during the French Revolution) the castle was partly destroyed. Descendants of the Lespinay and De Roug\u00e9 families still own it. The St Pierre Church: The St Pierre Church was built in the 19th century. Before that a Roman church was at this place, built in the 11th and 12th centuries. It was burnt during the war in the Vend\u00e9e by the Republican forces. The entrance of the previous church still exists, it has been transported stone by stone in the castle\u2019s park. The Crypt: The crypt, located near from the sacristy, was built in the 12th century. It is referenced as a historical monument since 1971. The previous train station: In 1898, a railroad was built to link Cholet to Les Sables d\u2019Olonne. Between La Roche sur Yon and Les Herbiers, there was the Les Essarts train station. The train disappeared in Les Essarts in 1950 and has been restored as a place to live. L\u2019Ansonni\u00e8re Mill: It is one of the last Mill that we could found before in this town.

It was founded in 1982 by Gary and Patricia Ellson, and was initially called Actors' Summer Theatre. Actors' Theatre presents plays by William Shakespeare and other time-honored playwrights, with relevance, to a contemporary audience. Actors' performs outdoors from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend at Schiller Park in German Village. In 1982 Actors' Theatre kicked off its first season with a single production of Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1590 and 1596). The success of that season proved that Schiller Park was an excellent venue for open air Shakespearean theater, and the troupe returned the following summer with two productions; Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" (1601\u201302), and the troupe's first Broadway musical, \"Oklahoma!\". In 2011, the troupe celebrated its 30th annual season. Over the last 30 years, the troupe has increased its schedule from one production to two in their second season, and three productions each summer from their third season on. They briefly increased to four productions during the 2005\u20132007 seasons, but have returned to three productions since the 2008 season.As part of their \"Cool Classics\" series, they have also occasionally performed at indoor venues. Two recent Cool Classics are Tennessee Williams' \"The Glass Menagerie\" (1944) in 2010 and James Thurber's \"The Male Animal\" (1942) in 2011, both at the Columbus Performing Arts Center. By far the most frequently produced play is Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", which has had five productions to date. The troupe first performed on the grass, and later on a simple wooden stage erected at the southern end of Schiller Park. The stage had to be erected and struck for each performance. Costumes and props were stored in the Ellson home nearby, which also served as dressing room and rehearsal space. In 1995, a permanent stage was constructed on the troupe's traditional performance site. This brick and concrete platform is completely open above, allowing the construction of multi-story sets that can remain intact throughout a production's run. The troupe's success is at least partly due to the popularity of open-air theatre in Columbus. The stage's scenic location within the park allows the audience to view the show from a gentle slope facing the stage. Audiences have a choice of bringing their own chairs, or using blankets. Food and drink are permitted during the shows. Outdoor summer shows are free and open to the public, though donations are encouraged. Although they had moved on to other activities years before, during the 2006 season Gary and Patricia Ellson returned to co-write, produce and direct a unique musical adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\". It would be the pair's final involvement with the troupe they had formed. Gary Ellson, already diagnosed with cancer during the shows run, succumbed to the disease in 2008. Artistic Director John S. Kuhn served the company from 2003 until 2015. Mr. Kuhn brought Actors' Theatre productions to several venues in Columbus, as well as training a new generation of ATC artists. He was succeeded by Philip J. Hickman.In 2016, Actors' Theatre expanded its summer season in Schiller Park to four productions.

GLTA-sanctioned tournaments provide a safe space for LGBT players to have fun playing competitive tennis in an environment where all who share the value of diversity are welcome.<PIC> The first gay tennis groups emerged in Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston as early as 1979. During the 1980s an informal gay and lesbian tennis \"circuit\" began to form. By the late 1980s gay tennis organizations were hosting tournaments that drew players from around the U.S., and the idea of a more formalized gay tennis circuit was becoming popular around the time of the 1990 Gay Games in Vancouver. The GLTA was founded in 1991, and there are now over 80 gay and lesbian member clubs around the world. The first officers were elected at the San Diego Open in July 1991. The first Commissioner of the GLTA was Scott Williford, who was also elected to the GLTA Hall of Fame in 1992 along with Les Balmain, who founded of the San Francisco Gay Tennis Federation in 1981. Other original GLTA board members were Norm Burgos, David Black, Chris Walker, and Gary Sutton.at their homes. Players at all levels can compete within divisions determined by ability\u2014the Open division being the highest, followed by divisions A, B, C, and D. Where possible, similar divisions are provided for players over 40 years old. Each year, an international GLTA World Tour Championships invites the top 8 players in each of the 5 GLTA divisions to compete. Tournaments are usually organized at a local level by clubs and associations, while the GLTA provides technical support, governance, and direction. Each event raises funds for charitable causes chosen by that particular association, and each cause usually has a tie to gay and lesbian issues such as HIV prevention or the mentoring of gay youth. The GLTA is developing partnerships with national sports organizations such as the United States Tennis Association (USTA) which have identified diversity as a worthwhile objective. The organization has begun to formulate a financial and organizational support strategy to bring events to communities where the political, legal, and cultural situation for gays and lesbians limits opportunities to compete in the sport without hiding their sexuality.", "images": ["w_s1376"], "tokens": 529}]}

Completed in 1939, she was assigned to the Black Sea Fleet. After the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) in June 1941, the ship helped to lay minefields off Sevastopol. During the Siege of Odessa the ship transported troops and supplies while providing naval gunfire support to the defenders until she was crippled by German dive bombers in September. Besposhchadny was further damaged by bombs while still under repair in November and they were not completed for almost another year. The ship ferried troops and supplies for the rest of the year and then provided fire support during an amphibious landing behind German lines in the Caucasus in February 1943. She later bombarded Axis positions and unsuccessfully attempted to intercept German convoys off the Crimea. After a one such attempt, Besposhchadny and two other destroyers were attacked by German aircraft in October. After repeated attacks, she was sunk with only 41 survivors.Having decided to build the large and expensive 40-knot (74 km/h; 46 mph) Leningrad-class destroyer leaders, the Soviet Navy sought Italian assistance in designing smaller and cheaper destroyers. They licensed the plans for the Folgore class and, in modifying it for their purposes, overloaded a design that was already somewhat marginally stable. The Gnevnys had an overall length of 112.8 meters (370 ft 1 in), a beam of 10.2 meters (33 ft 6 in), and a draft of 4.8 meters (15 ft 9 in) at deep load. The ships were significantly overweight, almost 200 metric tons (197 long tons) heavier than designed, displacing 1,612 metric tons (1,587 long tons) at standard load and 2,039 metric tons (2,007 long tons) at deep load. Their crew numbered 197 officers and sailors in peacetime and 236 in wartime. The ships had a pair of geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller, rated to produce 48,000 shaft horsepower (36,000 kW) using steam from three water-tube boilers which was intended to give them a maximum speed of 37 knots (69 km/h; 43 mph). The designers had been conservative in rating the turbines and many, but not all, of the ships handily exceeded their designed speed during their sea trials. Variations in fuel oil capacity meant that the range of the Gnevnys varied between 1,670 to 3,145 nautical miles (3,093 to 5,825 km; 1,922 to 3,619 mi) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph). As built, the Gnevny-class ships mounted four 130-millimeter (5.1 in) B-13 guns in two pairs of superfiring single mounts fore and aft of the superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a pair of 76.2-millimeter (3 in) 34-K AA guns in single mounts and a pair of 45-millimeter (1.8 in) 21-K AA guns as well as two 12.7-millimeter (0.50 in) DK or DShK machine guns. They carried six 533 mm (21.0 in) torpedo tubes in two rotating triple mounts; each tube was provided with a reload.The ships could also carry a maximum of either 60 or 95 mines and 25 depth charges. They were fitted with a set of Mars hydrophones for anti-submarine work, although they were useless at speeds over 3 knots (5.6 km/h; 3.5 mph). The ships were equipped with two K-1 paravanes intended to destroy mines and a pair of depth-charge throwers. Built in Nikolayev's Shipyard No. 198 (Andre Marti (South)) as yard number 322, Besposhchadny was laid down on 15 May 1936. The ship was completed on 22 August 1939 and was commissioned into the Black Sea Fleet on 2 October 1939. When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the ship was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Division of the Black Sea Fleet. On 23\u201325 June Besposhchadny laid 114 defensive mines off Sevastopol. On 9 July, the 2nd Destroyer Division, including the destroyer leader Kharkov, Besposhchadny and her sister ships Bodry, Boyky and Bezuprechny made an unsuccessful attempt to interdict Axis shipping near Fidonisi. Besposhchadny ran aground near the Eupatoria lighthouse on 14 July and damaged her propellers. After repairs, she began escorting cargo ships to Odessa while also transporting supplies and troops there. In addition, the ship provided gunfire support. On 14\u201317 August, Besposhchadny escorted the incomplete ships being evacuated from the shipyards at Nikolayev. The destroyer helped to escort transports ferrying the 157th Rifle Division to Odessa on 16\u201321 September. While providing fire support during the amphibious landing at Grigorievka on 22 September, Besposhchadny was attacked by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of StG 77. They nearly blew her bow off and she steamed to Odessa for emergency repairs. The following day, she was towed, stern-first, to Sevastopol by the destroyer Soobrazitelny. The ship was repaired using the salvaged bow from her sunken sister Bystry. While still under repair, Besposhchadny was attacked by Stukas from StG 77 on 12 November; they hit her once in the aft boiler room and near missed her several times. The bombs badly damaged her propulsion machinery and started a large fire.She was drydocked for emergency repairs on the 14th and was towed to Poti, Georgia three days later by the destroyer Shaumyan for further repairs that lasted until September 1942. While still under repair, Besposhchadny was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 4 April. The ship completed her post-repair sea trials and working up by 9 October and helped to ferry the 8th, 9th and 10th Guards Rifle Brigades and other troops from Poti to Tuapse on 19\u201328 October. On 29 November, Besposhchadny and Boyky were tasked to attack Axis shipping off the Bulgarian coast and to bombard the port of Mangalia, Romania. They failed to locate any ships and mistook coastal rocks for a convoy in heavy fog on 1 December, firing 141 shells from their main guns and six torpedoes at them. Besposhchadny, together with the light cruiser Krasnyi Krym and the destroyer Nezamozhnik, transported the 9th Mountain Rifle Division and other troops from Batumi, Georgia, to Tuapse in early December. Together with Soobrazitelny, Besposhchadny covered the sortie of a division of minesweepers off the Romanian coast and then unsuccessfully patrolled south of Fidonisi themselves on 26\u201329 December. The destroyer bombarded German positions around Novorossiysk on 1 February 1943 with 206 shells from her 130 mm guns. On 4 February, she provided fire support during the amphibious landing west of Novorossiysk, firing 151 illumination and 56 high-explosive shells. Besposhchadny fired 105 shells at Axis troops near Anapa on 13 February. During the rest of the month, the ship helped to ferry 8,037 troops from Tuapse to Gelendzhik. On the night of 30 April/1 May, Boyky and Besposhchadny shelled Axis positions on the Kerch Peninsula and then the ship bombarded Alushta on the night of 20/21 May. Boyky and Besposhchadny, together with the destroyer Sposobny made an unsuccessful attempt on 30 September to intercept German transports evacuating troops and equipment from the Kuban Bridgehead.During the night of 5/6 October, Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny attempted to intercept German evacuation convoys off the Crimean coast, but were again unsuccessful. Kharkov bombarded Yalta and Alushta while the two smaller destroyers steamed to do the same to Feodosia. The latter pair were attacked by five S-boats of the 1st S-Boat Flotilla en route. The Germans failed to damage either destroyer and Sposobny claimed one hit on S-45. On their way home the three ships were spotted by German reconnaissance aircraft and were attacked by Stukas of III./StG 3. Kharkov was damaged by their first attack and had to be towed by Sposobny. The second attack damaged all three ships and Sposobny alternated towing Besposhchadny and Kharkov. The next attack sank both Kharkov and Besposhchadny with only 41 crewmen rescued from the latter. This incident prompted Stalin to issue an order forbidding the use of ships destroyer-sized and larger without his express permission.<PIC> Yakubov & Worth, pp. 99, 102\u2013103 Yakubov & Worth, p. 101 Budzbon, p. 330 Yakubov & Worth, pp. 101, 106\u2013107 Hill, p. 40 Yakubov & Worth, pp. 101, 105\u2013106 Berezhnoy, p. 335 Rohwer & Monakov, p. 233 Yakubov & Worth, p. 109 Platonov, p. 194; Rohwer, pp. 80\u201381, 85, 92\u201394, 100, 102, 114; Yakubov & Worth, p. 109 Platonov, p. 194; Rohwer, pp. 204, 215\u2013216, 220 Platonov, pp. 194\u2013195; Rohwer, pp. 229, 231, 246, 251, 274, 280", "images": ["w_s1400"], "tokens": 2322}]}

The 722-bed hospital has featured combined public and private services since 1996. In March 2013, the new Joondalup Private Hospital opened next to the existing hospital, within the same campus. The public and private hospitals share the emergency department, operating theatres and intensive care facilities. The hospital's campus is now run by Ramsay Health Care, which also operates Attadale Private Hospital, Glengarry Private Hospital, Peel Health Campus and Hollywood Private Hospital. On 24 April 1996, then Health Minister Kevin Prince announced an expansion of the old Wanneroo hospital into a health campus. The tender to operate the facility was won by HealthCare Australia while the facility would be built by John Holland. The agreement to operate would last for twenty years. The agreement would provide care for both public and private patients with the current 84-beds increase to 330-beds of which 70 would be private beds.It would provide for an upgraded emergency service, 25-bed psychiatric services, aged care restorative unit, improved surgical, medical and obstetric services, expanded intensive care and coronary care, a 26-bed day surgery and endoscopic unit and a 24-bed paediatric unit, day oncology, renal dialysis, St John Ambulance depot, a medical centre, community health centre and hydrotherapy pool. The state government would spend $50 to $84 million on the expansion and would take 20 months. The state government would save the taxpayer $22 million over the contract period. The new emergency department was opened on 4 June 1997 by Health Minister Kevin Prince. The emergency department was expanded from a 5-bed unit to a 17-bed unit. In July, the west wing with its eight new birthing suites opened and a renal dialysis unit would open, after a staffing delay, on 9 September 1997. A north wing and theatres will open later in the year. The rest of the planned upgrades were completed in early 1998. In January 1998, a new intensive and coronary care unit opened as did a 24-bed paediatric ward. In late January 1998, a new 26 bed restorative unit, a 25-bed mental health service and a hydrotherapy pool were opened. The Joondalup Health Campus would officially open on 11 March 1998 by Premier Richard Court. In March 2003, Health Minister Bob Kucera announced that a $1.35 million Dental Clinic would be built at the Joondalup Health Campus. It would be a ten-chair clinic employing 24 staff members with construction starting in September 2003 and the completion date was March 2004. A new after-hours Clinic opened at the Joondalup Health Campus in September 2004. The aim was to relieve the emergency department from treating minor ailments. On 9 November 2009, a sod-turning ceremony was held at the Joondalup Health Campus that would see $317 million spent on upgrading the facilities at the hospital and see its size doubled. Ramsay Health would provide $90 million to a new private hospital with the rest of the money provided by the state government. Public beds would be increased to 451 from 280 beds, increased emergency department, new operating theatres and a 20-bed dialysis ward. Work was expected to be completed by 2013.Expansion continued and on 3 March 2011, a $29 million Emergency Department was opened with a total of 56 bays and separate areas for adults and children. A new public ward was opened worth $20.8 million and saw 55 new beds which included 51 single rooms, some with courtyards and two double bedrooms. On the 8 March 2012, Health Minister Kim Hames opened a new theatre block which included 12 new operating theatres. Seven opened immediately and the rest opened September of that year. Other facilities opened included a nine-bed intensive care unit, a six-bed high dependency unit and a ten-bed coronary care unit. The $394 million expansion was funded by the State Government who contributed $230 million, Ramsay Health contributed $163 million while the Federal Government contributed $1.4 million. On 6 June 2013, Health Minister Kim Hames opened the new private hospital at the Joondalup Health Campus. The development saw 145 new beds in the private wing and freed up 26 beds in the public wards. In June 2016, a $12.1 million Telethon Children's Ward open that expanded the beds from 24 to 37 beds and includes a giant aquarium, interactive play floors and an outdoor play space for children. Contributions for the expansion came from the WA Government, Telethon and Ramsey Health Care. During 2017, the JHC saw 100,000 people pass through the emergency department and the hospital saw 30,750 surgical procedures. Joondalup Health Campus opened a $7.1 million Mental Health Observation Area, adjacent to the emergency department in February 2018. Partially funded by Ramsey Health Care, the ten-bed area is made up of 4 bedrooms, 6 patient bays, a lounge, secure courtyard and waiting area. It was built by ADCO, and construction had started in 2017.In the WA 2018/19 State Budget, the Joondalup Health Campus has been allocated $158 million to add eight new operating theatres, 6 bed stroke unit, further expansion of the emergency department, more 90 inpatient and 75 mental health beds, 3 new cardiac catheter laboratories, a 25-bed Coronary Care Unit, urgent care clinic and a Medihotel.

Breizh atav), was a Breton nationalist journal in the mid-twentieth century. It was written in French, and has always been considered as a French nationalist journal by the non-francized Bretons. The term is also used for the broader movement associated with the journal's political position. Founded in 1918 in the aftermath of World War I, Breiz Atao would exist throughout the inter-war years. It was highly influenced by the Irish War of Independence, which began in 1916 and whose aftermath ran into the 1920s. Early on it adopted an official pan-Celtic policy, and a strong pan-Latin use of the French language. In its later years it became associated with a Nordicist blood and soil ideology with aspects in common with Nazism. It ceased publication in 1940, but was revived for an individual issue that appeared in 1944. The journal was first published in January 1919. Initially the editorial group focussed mostly on cultural aspects of Brittany, but very soon the journal evolved into the official forum of the Breton French-speaking autonomist movement. Its founders were Camille Le Mercier d'Erm, Job Loyant, Morvan Marchal and Job de Roinc\u00e9.It was founded by the Groupe R\u00e9gionaliste Breton, presided by Job Breiz, collaborating with Korentin Kerlann). They were soon joined by young French speaking intellectuals Yann Bricler, Olier Mordrel and Fran\u00e7ois Debauvais, who soon took up important roles within the group. Breiz Atao organised a congress (in French) in September 1927 in Rosporden at which the Breton Autonomist Party (Parti Autonomiste Breton, or PAB) was founded. At its first meeting Maurice Duhamel was charged with maintaining links with wider French speaking political movements in France, in particular the French left wing, and became chief-editor of Breiz Atao. He gave the PAB a leftist and federalistic stance. However during the 11 April 1931 congress, the PAB fractured into different factions. The factionalism led to the abandonment of the journal Breiz Atao, which was briefly replaced by the journal \"War Sao\", run by the nationalist faction in Tr\u00e9gor, Go\u00eblo and Cornouaille, who were preaching (in French) full Breton independence. On 27 December 1931, in Landerneau, the first congress of the new Parti National Breton took place. Breiz Atao reappeared as the mouthpiece of the militants led by Olier Mordrel and Fran\u00e7ois Debauvais. In March 1933, Breiz Atao published a draft political programme, drawn up by Mordrel. In this program, Mordrel created a proposed constitution for an independent Breton state, to which the French state should concede some of its resources, including overseas colonies, art, libraries, industrial equipment etc. Its borders would be determined \"by way of a plebiscite\". He also suggested the exclusion of foreigners from citizenship, and of all persons of mixed race; people from a Nordic background would be given preference. The new state should ensure \"control of youth's education, designed to make men physically and morally healthy\".In July 1940, at a Pontivy congress, Debeauvis and Mordrel decided on editing a new journal, L'Heure Bretonne (The Breton Hour). This journal succeeded Breiz Atao. However C\u00e9lestin Lain\u00e9, head of Bezen Perrot, an SS-affiliated militia, printed a one-off special issue in 1944, containing the recently deceased Debeauvais's statement of support for Lain\u00e9's activities.<PIC>", "images": ["w_s1448"], "tokens": 855}]}

He is currently a Senior Lecturer at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee in the Department of Journalism, Advertising, and Media Studies. A native Louisvillian, Tasman demonstrated his interest and engagement with new media art, culture, and technology from a young age. In 1984, when Tasman was 12 years old he won a computer programming contest sponsored by the Louisville Free Public Library. Local news featured him in a story about a computer whiz. Tasman received his Bachelor of Fine Arts in Studio Art and Photography in 1995 from the Allen R. Hite Art Institute at the University of Louisville where he achieved the Winthrop Allen Award for outstanding graduating B.F.A. Candidate. In 2000 he received his Master of Fine Arts in Photography from Ohio State University in the Department of Art, also winning the competitive Edith Fergus Gilmore materials grant and scholarship in subsequent years. In 1992 Tasman earned a certificate in Italian language and Art history of the Italian Renaissance at the Universit\u00e0 per Stranieri in Perugia, Italy. Tasman's work often combines documentary photography with elements of performance art and public interventions.Tasman is most well known for his time-lapse photography piece completed in 2009. Here he made a Polaroid instant film self-portrait every day for ten years and one day\u20143,654 consecutive days beginning on July 24, 1999. He decided to continue this practice for 10 years because of the significance of a decade and the common practice in popular media of reflecting on the passing of decades. Tasman admits he chose Polaroid film for its ease of use and lack of photographic processing to attain an image. However, there were other challenges in creating the work, especially in archiving the material body of self-portraits, such as remembering to write the dates on the back, to make sure that stacks of photos were not knocked over or disarrayed, the cost of the film, and the expense of digitizing thousands of photographs. Tasman discussed with Mark Metcalf how the medium also seemed fitting to when dealing with conceptual issues of memory and storytelling. After concluding the ten years and one day period, and having digitally scanned the images, Tasman created a video from all of these Polaroids. Dick Gordon, host of the radio program, The Story with Dick Gordon, on American Public Media suggested that Tasman's project that began in 1999, illuminates the dramatic transformation that imaging technology and it social uses have undergone. \"The funny thing is that the idea of a widely shared YouTube video was something that Marc could not even have conceived of\u2014the technology wasn't there.\" Art and architecture critic Mary Louise Schumacher for the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel wrote that Tasman's choice of the medium of Polaroid, \"seems eerily prescient,\" amidst the ubiquity of digital self-portraiture involved with social media, given that Polaroid stopped manufacturing film in 2009.In her review of the 2010 Wisconsin Triennial at the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, the museum's twelfth survey of artists living and working in the state, where Tasman created a 40 foot wide by 16 foot high installation of nearly 5000 Polaroids, Schumacher described a \"striking poignancy\" that this work takes on when she learned that Tasman's maternal great-grandparents were killed during World War II and that no photographs of them survived. \"Is he searching for the faces of lost relatives in the wall-filling installation of himself? Is the sheer endurance of his project a statement of survival?\" Art critic Katie Vaughn wrote that \"one feels almost stunned thinking about the time commitment involved in such a project\u2014and a similar feeling is evoked seeing the photographs en masse.\" Independent curator Joan Backes suggests that Tasman's piece \"represents a kind of dedication necessary for all artists, which is also a most distinguishing and inspiring characteristic of this work.\" This work is also featured in and on the cover of the book Reframing Photography: Theory and Practice, published in 2010 by Routledge.<PIC> Tasman's interventionist projects are frequently playful and political. After having several political yard signs stolen in the late summer of 2004, Tasman covered his remaining sign with oil and thorns, devised a crude motion sensitive sonic alarm, set up an infrared camcorder at his front door and recorded the nighttime scene. Tasman constructed a website, as this was before the advent of YouTube, where he posted the video clips of \"the would-be thieves and their often humorous reactions\" to being caught in the booby trap. As the trap proved to be a successful deterrent, local television and radio news broadcasts dubbed him the Video Vigilante. In 2007, his video which compiled eight failed attempts to steal the signs, \"Who is Stealing My Signs?\" was selected for the Ann Arbor Film Festival's competition program.used Tasman's Creative Commons licensed images and videos including The Huffington Post, Mother Jones, The Drudge Report, BuzzFeed, and Clarion to illustrate articles about this series of demonstrations and political actions in Wisconsin. Matt Stopera in an article for BuzzFeed compiling photographs of \"The 100 Best Protest Signs At The Wisconsin Capitol,\" included Tasman's images from the February 16, 2011, ranking the image \"Protesters at the end of the day,\" number two on this list. Michael Shaw, writing for Bag News and The Huffington Post used Tasman's photo, \"Firefighters led the protest into the State Capitol\" to corroborate claims that images taken from archival video footage of protests in February 2011 in Madison, Wisconsin, used in a 2012 Super Bowl commercial, Halftime in America were digitally manipulated to remove the pro-union, pro-public education messages on the picket signs.", "images": ["w_s1487"], "tokens": 1360}]}

A supporter of Linares and Constitutionalist government, he later served in Congress during the 1870s until the time of the Daza dictatorship. Unlike other capable leaders of his day, Arce did not enlist to serve when the War of the Pacific developed in 1879. Indeed, his became one of the most accommodationist voices in the political spectrum, perhaps as a result of his extensive business connections to Chile, where he sold much of his silver, invested his profits, and sought financing for his projects. His position was that the Litoral was, for various lamentable reasons, largely indefensible. Thus, the country should cut its losses and seek an alliance with Chile rather than with Peru.Despite this minority position, what rang more clearly in the ears of most Bolivians was Arce's steadfast call for the establishment of a conservative democratic order, with the primacy of law, regular elections, and rule by enlightened pro-business elites such as himself. To this end, he founded the Conservative Party, participated as one of the principals in the 1880 Congress that toppled Hilari\u00f3n Daza, and had a role in the drafting of the country's new Constitution.

A rent-to-own transaction differs from a traditional lease, in that the lessee can purchase the leased item at any time during the agreement (in a traditional lease the lessee has no such right), and from a hire purchase/installment plan, in that the lessee can terminate the agreement by simply returning the property (in a hire purchase the buyer has a limited time, if any, to cancel the agreement). The usage of rent-to-own transactions began in the United Kingdom and Europe, and first appeared in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. While rent-to-own terminology is most commonly associated with consumer goods transactions, the term is sometimes used in connection with real estate transactions.<PIC> The concept of rent-to-own transactions first emerged in the United Kingdom and continental European countries under the hire purchase model.

The external examiner system originated in 1832 with the establishment of the University of Durham, the first in England since Cambridge was founded 600 years earlier. Durham used Oxford examiners to assure the public that its degrees were a similar standard to Oxford's. The establishment of more universities in England from the 1880s was accompanied by a requirement that examinations be conducted by internal and external examiners. It is also found in countries whose higher education systems were developed from United Kingdom practice, or strongly influenced by it, after its introduction, including New Zealand, and India. It is one of the oldest systems of quality control within higher education. It is a requirement for all degree level examinations at British universities, and in countries operating a similar system, that at least one member of the examining board should be from a university other than the one awarding the degree (and should have no recent affiliation with it). This applies both to undergraduate examinations, where there may be hundreds or even thousands of candidates, and to postgraduate examinations including those for the PhD where a special board is convened for each candidate.<PIC> While the role of the external examiner varies with the level of examination, the purpose of the system remains the same: to ensure that standards are kept the same across universities, and to provide an assurance of fair play given that internal examiners might be prejudiced for or against a candidate.

In undergraduate and taught postgraduate examinations, external examiners typically see and have to approve draft examination questions before the papers are set; and they will review the marks and the work of aften at the busiest time of the academic year.

A RecA structural and functional homolog has been found in every species in which one has been seriously sought and serves as an archetype for this class of homologous DNA repair proteins. The homologous protein is called RAD51 in eukaryotes and RadA in archaea. RecA has multiple activities, all related to DNA repair. In the bacterial SOS response, it has a co-protease function in the autocatalytic cleavage of the LexA repressor and the \u03bb repressor. RecA's association with DNA major is based on its central role in homologous recombination. The RecA protein binds strongly and in long clusters to ssDNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. The protein has more than one DNA binding site, and thus can hold a single strand and double strand together. This feature makes it possible to catalyze a DNA synapsis reaction between a DNA double helix and a complementary region of single-stranded DNA. The RecA-ssDNA filament searches for sequence similarity along the dsDNA. A disordered DNA loop in RecA, Loop 2, contains the residues responsible for DNA homologous recombination.In some bacteria, RecA posttranslational modification via phosphorylation of a serine residue on Loop 2 can interfere with homologous recombination. The search process induces stretching of the DNA duplex, which enhances sequence complementarity recognition (a mechanism termed conformational proofreading). The reaction initiates the exchange of strands between two recombining DNA double helices. After the synapsis event, in the heteroduplex region a process called branch migration begins. In branch migration an unpaired region of one of the single strands displaces a paired region of the other single strand, moving the branch point without changing the total number of base pairs. Spontaneous branch migration can occur, however, as it generally proceeds equally in both directions it is unlikely to complete recombination efficiently. The RecA protein catalyzes unidirectional branch migration and by doing so makes it possible to complete recombination, producing a region of heteroduplex DNA that is thousands of base pairs long. Since it is a DNA-dependent ATPase, RecA contains an additional site for binding and hydrolyzing ATP. RecA associates more tightly with DNA when it has ATP bound than when it has ADP bound. In Escherichia coli, homologous recombination events mediated by RecA can occur during the period after DNA replication when sister loci remain close. RecA can also mediate homology pairing, homologous recombination and DNA break repair between distant sister loci that had segregated to opposite halves of the E. coli cell. E. coli strains deficient in RecA are useful for cloning procedures in molecular biology laboratories. E. coli strains are often genetically modified to contain a mutant recA allele and thereby ensure the stability of extrachromosomal segments of DNA, known as plasmids. In a process called transformation, plasmid DNA is taken up by the bacteria under a variety of conditions. Bacteria containing exogenous plasmids are called \"transformants\".Transformants retain the plasmid throughout cell divisions such that it can be recovered and used in other applications. Without functional RecA protein, the exogenous plasmid DNA is left unaltered by the bacteria. Purification of this plasmid from bacterial cultures can then allow high-fidelity PCR amplification of the original plasmid sequence.<PIC> Wigle and Singleton at the University of North Carolina have shown that small molecules interfering with RecA function in the cell may be useful in the creation of new antibiotic drugs. Since many antibiotics lead to DNA damage, and all bacteria rely on RecA to fix this damage, inhibitors of RecA could be used to enhance the toxicity of antibiotics. Additionally the activities of RecA are synonymous with antibiotic resistance development, and inhibitors of RecA may also serve tocoming DNA to the corresponding site in the B. subtilis chromosome where informational exchange occurs. Michod et al. have reviewed evidence that RecA-mediated transformation is an adaptation for homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage in B. subtilis, as well as in several other bacterial species (i.e. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans and Helicobacter pylori). In the case of the pathogenic species that infect humans, it was proposed that RecA-mediated repair of DNA damages may be of substantial benefit when these bacteria are challenged by the oxidative defenses of their host.", "images": ["w_s1578"], "tokens": 1106}]}

He also served as a Member of Parliament in the 1970s. He was best known for his studies of Maoist China, the three-volume The Origins of the Cultural Revolution and Mao's Last Revolution. MacFarquhar was born in Lahore, British India (now Pakistan). His father was Sir Alexander MacFarquhar, a member of the Indian Civil Service and later a senior diplomat at the United Nations. His mother was Berenice (n\u00e9e Whitburn). He was educated at the Aitchison College in Lahore and Fettes College, an independent school in Edinburgh. After spending part of his national service from 1949 to 1950 in Egypt and Jordan as a second lieutenant in the Royal Tank Regiment, he went up to Keble College, Oxford to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics, obtaining a BA in 1953. He then went on to obtain a master's degree from Harvard University in Far Eastern Regional Studies in 1955, studying with John King Fairbank, who supported his career as a China scholar. He worked as a journalist on the staff of the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph from 1955 to 1961 specialising in China, and also reported for BBC television Panorama from 1963 to 1965.He was the founding editor of The China Quarterly from 1959 to 1968, and a non-resident fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford, from 1965 to 1968. In 1969 he was a senior research fellow at Columbia University in New York City, and in 1971 he returned to England to hold a similar fellowship at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. MacFarquhar completed his doctorate at the London School of Economics in 1981. In the 1966 general election, MacFarquhar fought the Ealing South constituency for the Labour Party but failed to dislodge the sitting Conservative MP. Two years later, he was Labour candidate who attempted to retain the Meriden seat in a by-election; he was on the wrong end of an 18.4% swing at the height of the Wilson government's unpopularity. Following the defeat of George Brown in 1970 and favourable boundary changes, MacFarquhar was selected to fight the Belper constituency, and at the February 1974 general election succeeded in winning the seat from its sitting Conservative MP Geoffrey Stewart-Smith. Although he won, there was an estimated swing of 4% to the Conservatives had the same boundaries applied in the previous election. MacFarquhar proved a moderate figure, in line with Brown's views. He abstained on a vote to remove the disqualification of left-wing Labour councillors in Clay Cross who had broken council housing laws enacted by the previous Conservative government. However, there were exceptions: he also abstained on a vote to increase the Civil list payments on 26 February 1975. He acted as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to David Ennals, a minister of the state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and retained the job when Ennals was promoted to be Secretary of State for Social Services. He was made a member of the Select Committee on Science and Technology. In 1978 MacFarquhar resigned his office as PPS after voting against the Government.In that year, he became a Governor of the School of Oriental and African Studies, a University of London constituent body. The post gave him a job which he could do if he lost his seat. In the 1979 general election, MacFarquhar did indeed lose by 800 votes, and returned to academia and broadcasting (returning to \"24 Hours\" for a year). He remained involved in politics and his moderate beliefs made him increasingly uncomfortable in the Labour Party: on 22 October 1981 he announced that he had joined the Social Democratic Party. He fought the South Derbyshire seat, which contained most of then-abolished Belper, for the SDP in the 1983 general election, and nearly succeeded in beating the Labour candidate, although the seat was easily won by theConservatives.

In 1915, Practical electric wiring described it as being, \"by far the most widely used splice\" in practical electrical wiring work. NASA included the splice in its technical standard Workmanship Standard For Crimping, Interconnecting Cables, Harnesses, And Wiring, first produced in 1998. The 1915 textbook Practical electric wiring describes the construction of the Western Union splice; short tie and long tie.The short tie splice has it being formed after stripping the insulation from a pair of wires for several inches, each, crossing the wires left over right as shown in figure part A; then, a hooked cross (figure part B) is formed holding the crossing point of the two wires, and pulling the right wire tip toward and pushing the left wire tip away from the worker, leaving the tips oriented vertically as shown. The wires are then held with pliers to the left of their crossing point while the right splice is formed by continuing to wind the wire tip away from the worker, creating 5-6 twists snug against the core wire and against each preceding twist. NASA recommend \"tight, with no gaps between adjacent turns.\" The wires are then again held with pliers, but on the first-made twist, to the right of the crossing point, and then the left splice is formed by winding the remaining wire tip toward the worker for a comparable 5-6 snug twists. The splice wire ends are then trimmed as needed, and the splice may then be soldered, and/or covered (e.g., with a heat-shrunk tube of insulation). Practical electric wiring described the splice as having two variations, the \"short tie\" (figure part D) and \"long tie\" (figure parts E or F), with the latter examples having a \"twist between wrappings [that] allows a better chance for solder to pass in between the wires\". The book suggested the long tie variant more suited to splices where soldering was intended. However, this was not backed up by NASA testing.<PIC> The NASA tests included soldering, and were performed to an organizational standard operating procedure (NASA-STD-8739.3) for a solder termination, which includes a number of specific requirements, including \"proper insulation spacing\"; tight wrapping; trimming of wire ends to prevent protrusions through the solder; and over-sleeving with a transparent or translucent heat shrink seal to cover the completed splice and all exposed metal. NASA found both the short- and long tie variant to be strong when soldered. The splices were examined in tensile strength (\"pull\") tests on 16 and 22 American wire gauge wire; even the short tie variation of the Western Union splice performed well after soldering.The test splices never failed at the splice (instead breaking outside of the splice area), leaving NASA to conclude that \"the solder connection at the splice was as strong or stronger than the un-spliced wires.\"", "images": ["w_s1605"], "tokens": 823}]}

Unlike the majority of pathogenic Cephaleuros species it penetrates the epidermis of plants, and is not constrained to subcuticular growth. It has sometimes been misidentified as Cephaleuros virescens. Cortex penetration, and the naming as red rust of tea are marked differentiators of C. parasiticus from its relative C. virescens which does not penetrate the epidermis. It has been renamed several times as more phylogenetic information has become available.<PIC> The disease is increasingly a concern in tea plantations throughout the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka in recent decades. It is also present in Chinese tea plantations, although apparently to a lesser extent. In some cases it can necessitate large scale replanting, which are especially vulnerable to C. parasiticus. It may present in up to one quarter of all tea plantations in Bangladesh, and is one of the major threats to the tea plantation industry. It has long been identified as a concern for the industry, with publications dating back to 1907.Cultural practices such as eliminating weed shade and maintaining soil health have also been mentioned as important for the management of C. parasiticus. The mechanism of resistance from potash spraying is related to vigorous plant growth, as potash is an important nutrient for tea plants. The use of potash in conjunction with bordeaux spraying reduced the severity of the disease impact on crop yields. This is supported by findings that vigorous growth in young plants reduces the severity of an infection. Spraying with copper based fungicides up to three times throughout the summer, especially as the alga sporulates, will control the disease. Pruning infected branches can also help plants recover.", "images": ["w_s1609"], "tokens": 429}]}

Hermann Franke founded a sheet metal business in his name in Rorschach, Switzerland, in 1911. In the late 1920s the economic upturn in the industry and construction sector led to the incorporation of a sanitary installations department. Franke began with the production of oven tops, skylights and dormer windows. In the 1930s Franke started production of the first sink units in nickeline, monel-metal and later in stainless steel. Franke built a new factory with offices and residential building, and the company's ten employees relocated to Aarburg, Switzerland. Franke initiated the first production series and the first fully welded, smooth sink unit. Hermann Franke died on January 25, 1939, and his son Walter took over the business. The Second World War led to great difficulties in obtaining materials. During the years after the war the company's factory facilities expanded and the production of complete kitchens began.Franke started to export products to European countries. The construction sector developed encouragingly. Business expanded rapidly. Franke sold kitchen sinks. In 1950 the Washroom and Sanitary Equipment product group was established as part of Franke with products for communal washrooms and WCs. Production of components for propulsion systems began. Franke saw its first foreign investment in Germany and by 1955 had 500 employees. In the late 1950s, Franke's production doubled. Factory facilities were expanded further. A \"Commercial Kitchens\" division was founded. By 1961 Franke had 750 employees. Over the next twelve years Franke experienced rapid growth: 13 new subsidiaries were established and two companies began manufacturing under license. In 1972, Franke built and installed the first kitchen for McDonald's in Munich. By 1974 the company had 2,600 employees. In 1975 Franke ownership changes: Walter Franke's friend and business partner Willi Pieper took over. Four subsidiaries and two licensees were added to the group. In 1979 the Franke compact sink system was introduced. In the late 1980s the divisional organization was established. Michael Pieper joined Group Management in 1989.

Following retirement in 2015, he has become a color commentator for Dragons broadcasts for the NHK. Playing for Tohoku Fukushi University, Wada was MVP of the Sendai Big Six University League as a senior and won the batting title. He hit.429 for Kobe Seiko in the industrial leagues, then in 1996 was drafted in the fourth round of the Japanese draft by the Seibu Lions. He hit.190 in 1997 when he first played for Seibu and was 0/1 in the 1997 Japan Series. In 1998, Wada hit.333 in 36 games for Seibu and split his time between catching and the outfield. He went 0/2 in the 1998 Japan Series. In 1999, he batted.271 while again seeing limited time behind the plate, with Tsutomu Ito starting. In 1998, Wada began playing semiregularly as an outfielder, batting.306, the same average he recorded the next year.

He is remembered today as one of the first Europeans to both learn and teach Japanese martial arts and as a pioneer of the concept of hybrid martial arts. He was born Edward William Wright on 8 November 1860 in Bangalore, Madras, India, the third of nine children of railway engineer William Barton Wright and his wife Janet, generally called Jessie. She was the daughter of Australian pastoralist and politician William Forlonge and granddaughter of the Australian pioneer breeder of Merino sheep, Eliza Forlonge. E.W. Wright was educated at Dedham Grammar School, Essex, at Lens, Pas-de-Calais in France, and in Germany. He then worked as a clerk for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway before embarking on a career as a civil and mining engineer. He worked as manager for his father's mining interests based near Odemira in the Alentejo region of Portugal, from 1886 to 1892, without success. In April 1892 he legally assumed the name Edward William Barton-Wright.Returning to England in 1892, he promoted a company, Barton Wright Ltd., antimony specialists, at Millwall, London, but was declared personally bankrupt for the first time the following year. He then worked for mining companies in Egypt and the Straits Settlements (modern day Malaysia and Singapore). In a 1950 interview Barton-Wright professed to having had a \"lifelong interest in the arts of self defence\" and earlier interviews indicated that he had studied various fighting systems during his travels as a young man. While working as an antimony smelting specialist for the E.H. Hunter Company in Kobe, Japan (c. 1895\u20131898), Barton-Wright studied jujutsu in at least two styles, including the Shinden Fudo Ry\u016b in Kobe and Kodokan judo in Tokyo. Upon returning to England in early 1898, Barton-Wright combined these martial arts to form his own method of self-defence training, which he called Bartitsu. Over the next two years, he also added elements of British boxing, French savate and the la canne (stick fighting) style of Swiss master Pierre Vigny. In 1899, Barton-Wright wrote an article titled \"How to Pose as a Strong Man\", detailing the mechanical and leverage principles employed in performing various feats of strength. He also produced a two-part essay entitled \"the New Art of Self Defence\" which was published in both the English and American editions of Pearson's Magazine. Excerpts of Barton-Wright's articles were re-printed in numerous British, American, New Zealand and Australian newspapers. In 1900, Barton-Wright established the Bartitsu School of Arms and Physical Culture at 67b Shaftesbury Avenue in London's Soho district. The school offered classes in a range of self-defence disciplines and combat sports as well as various physical therapies involving the electrical application of heat, light, vibration, and radiation. Club members included soldiers, athletes, actors, politicians and some aristocrats.During the next few years, Barton-Wright organised numerous exhibitions of self-defence techniques and also promoted tournament competitions at music halls throughout London, in which his Bartitsu Club champions were challenged by wrestlers in various European styles. In 1901, Barton-Wright published additional articles that detailed the Bartitsu method of fighting with a walking stick or umbrella. In The Adventure of the Empty House, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, referred to Bartitsu (misspelled as \"baritsu\") in explaining how Holmes had defeated Professor Moriarty in hand-to-hand combat at the brink of the Reichenbach Falls. During early 1902, Barton-Wright organised and promoted the \"Great Anglo-Japanese Tournament\" tour, which featured Bartitsu demonstrations and contests in provincial centers including Nottingham, the Sandringham Military Base, Oxford, Cambridge University and Lancashire.<PIC> By 1903, the Bartitsu Club had closed down. Subsequently, Barton-Wright mostly abandoned self-defence instruction in favour of his interests in physical therapy. He established a series of clinics at various locations throughout London, and continued to work as a physical therapist for the remainder of his career. His therapeutic business, specialising in the use of various electrical appliances to treat the pain of gout and rheumatism, was viewed with suspicion by the London medical establishment and was subject to bankruptcy proceedings on several occasions during the first three decades of the 20th century. These included a damaging and acrimonious suit brought about by Wilson Rae, a former employee who had become a business rival and who was subsequently jailed on charges of fraud and bigamy. Barton-Wright's financial problems were compounded by a series of investments in unsuccessful inventions and other ventures, including an electrical display planned for an Amsterdam music hall. E.W.Cyrus Barker, the protagonist of novelist Will Thomas' Barker and Llewellyn mystery series, is partly inspired by E.W. Barton-Wright, as is the villainous Sir Callum Fielding-Shaw in Adrienne Kress' young adult novel The Friday Society. E. W.

The book's context is the history of immunology, from the earliest questioning about why people become ill and why some may recover, to the 19th century pioneers who demonstrated that bacteria caused many diseases.The biologist Rebecca Nesbit, reviewing The Compatibility Gene for The Biologist, writes that Davis shares many stories of dedicated scientists, brought together by \"a small cluster of 'compatibility genes' which play a large role in how we react to disease, and are central to how our immune systems work.\" She notes that the book is as much about the people as the discoveries, but these are made worthwhile by the medical advances they keep producing, for example with possibilities for personalised medicine, as when people with one particular compatibility gene react adversely to an AIDS drug.

It was found in an Etruscan tomb at Monte Aguzzo, near Veio, on Prince Mario Chigi\u2019s estate in 1881. The vase has been variously assigned to the middle and late Proto-Corinthian periods and given a date of ca. 650\u2013640 BC; it is now in the National Etruscan Museum, Villa Giulia, Rome (inv. No.22679). The vase stands 26 cm (10.2 inches) tall, which is modest compared to other Greek vases. Some three-quarters of the vase is preserved. It was found amidst a large number of potsherds of mixed provenance, including one bucchero vessel inscribed with five lines in two early Etruscan alphabets announcing the ownership of Atianai, perhaps also the original owner of the Chigi vase.The Chigi vase itself is a polychrome work decorated in four friezes of mythological and genre scenes and four bands of ornamentation; amongst these tableaux is the earliest representation of the hoplite phalanx formation \u2013 the sole pictorial evidence of its use in the mid- to late-7th century, and terminus post quem of the \"hoplite reform\" that altered military tactics. The lowest frieze is a hunting scene in which three naked short-haired hunters and a pack of dogs endeavour to catch hares and one vixen; a kneeling hunter carries a lagobolon (a throwing cudgel used in coursing hares) as he signals to his fellows to stay behind a bush. It is not clear from the surviving fragments if a trap is being used, as was common in depictions of such expeditions. The next frieze immediate above suggests a collocation of four or five unrelated events. First a parade of long-haired horsemen, each of whom is leading a riderless horse. Possibly these are squires or hippobates for some absent cavalrymen or hippobateis; the latter, it has been conjectured, may be the hoplites seen elsewhere on the vase.The riders are confronted with a two-bodied sphinx with a floral crown and an archaic smile. It is not clear if the creature is participating in any of the action in this frieze. Behind the sphinx is a lion-hunting scene in which four youths wearing cuirasses (save for one who is nude, but belted) spear a lion which has a fifth figure in its jaws. Whether there were indigenous lions in the Peloponnese at this time is a matter for speculation. moreover the shock-haired mane of the lion betrays a neo-Assyrian influence, perhaps the first such in Corinthian art and replacing the previously dominant Hittite forms. Finally in this section, and just below the handle, is a Judgement of Paris scene. Above is another hunting scene, albeit of animals only: dogs chasing stags, goats and hares. In the highest and largest frieze is the scene that has attracted the most scholarly attention \u2013 a battle involving hoplite warfare. However this characterization is not without its problems. For one thing, the hoplites shown here meeting at the moment of othismos (or \"push\") do not carry short swords, but instead like their Homeric forebears have two spears; one for thrusting and one for throwing.Further, Tyrtaeus (11.11-14 West) does not mention a supporting second rank as it may be represented; it is far from self-evident this is a second rank depicted on the vase or that it supports the first. To render the phalanx tactics unambiguously the painter would have had to have given a bird's-eye view of the action, a perspective unknown in Greek vase painting. Consequently it is not clear if the hoplite formation shown here is the developed form as it was practiced from the 6th century onwards. Lastly aulos-players and cadenced marching are not attested in literature from the Archaic Period, so the aulos-player drawn here cannot have served in reality to keep the troops in step: what function he had, if any, is open to speculation. However, Thucydides does state that a Spartan phalanx in the Battle of Mantinea was accompanied by aulos-players in order to keep step as they approached the opposing army, which may suggest that they were used in the same way at the time when the vase was made.<PIC> The Judgement of Paris on the Chigi vase is the earliest extant depiction of the myth, evidence perhaps of knowledge of the lost epic Cypria from the 650s BC. The figure of Paris is labelled Alexandros in the Homeric manner, though the writer might not be the same as the painter since the inscriptions are not typically Corinthian. This scene, obscured under the handle and \u201cpainted somehow as an afterthought\u201d according to John Boardman. invites the question whether the events on this vase (and vases generally) are random juxtapositions of images or present a narrative or overarching theme. In line with recent scholarship of the Paris structuralist school Jeffrey Hurwit suggests that reading upwards along the vertical axis we can discern the development of the ideal Corinthian man from boyhood through agones and paideia to full warrior-citizen, with the sphinx marking the liminal stages in his maturation.", "images": ["w_s1710"], "tokens": 1312}]}

(1999) as one of the possible outcomes of functional divergence that occurs after a gene duplication event, in which pairs of genes that originate from duplication, or paralogs, take on separate functions. Subfunctionalization is a neutral mutation process of constructive neutral evolution; meaning that no new adaptations are formed. During the process of gene duplication paralogs simply undergo a division of labor by retaining different parts (subfunctions) of their original ancestral function. This partitioning event occurs because of segmental gene silencing leading to the formation of paralogs that are no longer duplicates, because each gene only retains a single function. It is important to note that the ancestral gene was capable of performing both functions and the descendant duplicate genes can now only perform one of the original ancestral functions.<PIC> Subfunctionalization after gene duplication is thought to be the newer model of functional divergence. Before 1910, scientists were unaware that genes were capable of multifunctionalization. The original thought was that each gene possessed one function, but in fact genes have independently mutable regions and possessed the ability to subfunctionalize.Conversely, hemoglobin consists of both \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains, with \u03b12-\u03b22 being among the most efficient forms of hemoglobin in the human genome. This is a prime example of subfunctionalization. Another good example is the emergence of fetal hemoglobin from embryonic hemoglobin after duplication of the hemoglobin \u03b3- chain. This example of subfunctionalization illustrates how different forms of hemoglobin are present at various developmental stages. In fact, there is distinct hemoglobin at each developmental stage: \u03b62-\u03b52 and \u03b12-\u03b52 in the embryo, \u03b12-\u03b32 in the fetus, and \u03b12-\u03b22 and \u03b12-\u03b42 in adults. Each type of hemoglobin has advantages that are particular to the developmental stage in which it thrives. For example, embryonic and fetal hemoglobin have higher oxygen affinity than adult hemoglobin giving them improved functionality in hypoxic environments such as the uterus.", "images": ["w_s1725"], "tokens": 516}]}

As a senior at Terry High School in 2005, he racked up 304 carries for 2,683 yards (8.8 average) and 31 touchdowns in leading Terry to an 11-2 mark. He was named the Jackson metro-area player of the year by The Clarion-Ledger. He was also a first-team All-State honoree by the paper, and was named to its (preseason) \"Dandy Dozen\" team (of the state's 12 best high school players) and its (postseason) \"10 Most Wanted\" list (of the state's top 10 college football prospects). Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Dixon was listed as the No. 22 running back prospect in the nation in 2006. Scout.com ranked Dixon a four star prospect and the 30th best running back in the country. He chose Mississippi State over University of Alabama, Louisiana State University, and Southern Miss.In his true freshman season, Dixon played in all 12 games, starting five times, and set MSU true freshman records for rushing attempts, yards gained rushing, and touchdowns rushing. His nine touchdowns on the ground were the most by a Bulldog since Dicenzo Miller's ten TDs in 2000. He earned his nickname \"Boobie\" from his college teammates, who compared him to Boobie Miles, the character in Friday Night Lights. As a sophomore, Dixon played all 13 games and started twelve. He became just the seventh halfback (ninth occurrence) in school history and the first Bulldog sophomore ever to surpass 1,000 yards rushing in a single season and his attempts set a Mississippi State single season record. He scored MSU's game-winning touchdown in the 2007 Liberty Bowl game. During his junior season, Dixon started all 12 games he played in, and rushed for 869 yards, compiling a career-best 4.4 yards per carry. With 1,391 rushing yards in his senior season, Dixon not only set the Mississippi State single-season rushing record (surpassing J. J. Johnson's 1998 record of 1,383 yards), he also became the seventh player in Southeastern Conference history to lead his team in rushing four times. He joined Eddie Price (Tulane, 1946\u20131949), Sonny Collins (Kentucky, 1972\u20131975), Dalton Hilliard (LSU, 1982\u20131985), Carl Woods (Vanderbilt, 1983\u20131986), Errict Rhett (Florida, 1990\u20131993), and Kevin Faulk (LSU, 1995\u20131998) on that list. Dixon accumulated 3,994 career rushing yards during his collegiate career. In addition, Dixon also accumulated 56 receptions, 449 Receiving Yards, and 4 Receiving Touchdowns in 4 years at MSU. Dixon was considered one of the best \"power backs\" available in the 2010 NFL Draft, alongside Toby Gerhart and Charles Scott. Projected as a third- to fourth-round pick, Dixon was thought to possibly be the Bulldogs' highest draftee since Jerious Norwood was selected by the Atlanta Falcons in the third round (79th overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft.However, he was selected as the 173rd overall pick in the sixth round by the San Francisco 49ers. With the announcement of the sudden retirement of Glen Coffee on August 13, former head coach Mike Singletary stated that Dixon and veteran Michael Robinson would compete for the number 2 running back spot behind Pro Bowler Frank Gore. In the preseason, Dixon posted 74 rushes for 300 yards, averaging 75 yards per game and 4 touchdowns, leading the entire NFL in each of those categories. On September 20, 2010, Dixon rushed for his first career NFL touchdown against the New Orleans Saints on Monday Night Football. Despite playing well in the preseason, Dixon had only ten rushing attempts until week 12. After Gore suffered a fractured hip during a Monday Night Football game against the Arizona Cardinals on November 29, Dixon had 14 carries for 54 yards and a touchdown as a backup to Brian Westbrook, who took over for Gore. Dixon played in all72 games of his NFL career, primarily on special teams. At the end of the 2012 season, Dixon and the 49ers appeared in Super Bowl XLVII. He contributed on special teams, but the 49ers fell to the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 34\u201331. His only start as a member of the 49ers came in the 2013 NFC Championship game as a fullback, scoring a touchdown that gave San Francisco a 10\u20130 lead. Coincidentally, that was his last game as a member of the 49ers. He finished his 49er career with 458 regular-season rushing yards and eight touchdowns.<PIC> On March 15, 2014, Dixon signed a three-year, $3.5 million contract with the Buffalo Bills. Dixon went on to have the most productive year of his career, with career highs in rushing attempts (105), rushing yards (432), average yards per rush (4.1), as well as passes caught and receiving yardage (eight catches for 49 yards). Dixon also scored two rushing touchdowns, the same number he had scored each year since entering the NFL. In 2015, Dixon's production dropped off significantly. He had only one rushing touchdown, and recorded both 44 yards rushing and 44 yards receiving.the game, Dixon caught a 4 yard touchdown pass from David Ash. Both plays occurred on 4th down, and were the first and last scores of the game, respectively. Dixon's totals were 7 carries for 55 yards, 5 catches for 23 yards, and the two touchdowns. With 78 total yards on 12 touches, Dixon was short of his statistical pregame prediction, but nonetheless he was listed as one of the Stand Out Players of the game during the Summer Showcase broadcast. Dixon is a Christian. Dixon describes himself on his Twitter account as a \"God Fearing Man\" and frequently tweets about his faith. Anthony also has three younger brothers Antwon, Rashun, and Deshun (from oldest to youngest). Antwon and Rashun both committed to play football at Mississippi State, although neither played at MSU. Antwon instead went to Hinds Community College before transferring to Midwestern State University.

Situated 13.09 kilometers (8.13 mi) from Oslo Central Station, it consists of two side platforms along a double tracked line and a disused station building. H\u00f8ybr\u00e5ten is served by the L1 line of the Norwegian State Railways's Oslo Commuter Rail. Its station is the second in Oslo's Tram network, the first being R\u00f8dby station, which was built in the late 1800s. Trunk lines were once the main railway network in Scandinavia, providing transportation throughout Scandinavia. In 1863 Trunk Line Norway was founded, in place of the non-existent Board of Railways, which was found wanting in providing rural- and mountainous-only railways. The station opened as H\u00f8ibr\u00e5ten on 20 October 1921, following the establishment of a residential area the previous decade and a half. It received a wooden station building designed by Gudmund Hoel. From 1927 it also had electric traction and all local trains started to stop at the station. It took its current name the following year. H\u00f8ybr\u00e5ten remained staffed until 1967.<PIC> The Trunk Line past H\u00f8ybr\u00e5ten opened on 1 September 1854 and residents were served by Grorud Station, some 2.5 kilometers (1.6 mi) to the southwest. L\u00f8renskog Station, then named Robsrud, opened on 20 April 1891, 1,070 meters (3,510 ft) the northeast. In 1899 there were still only about one hundred people living in the area, most of which lived on one of the four H\u00f8ybr\u00e5ten farms. The segment of track was doubled in 1903. From 1905 Anton Tschudi started selling lots from his farm \u00d8vre H\u00f8ybr\u00e5ten, which were affordable for ordinary workers. However, to settle so far from the city center it was necessary to get a better transport service. Trains were available from L\u00f8renskog, but the first service did not arrive at Oslo East Station until 07:40, too late for industry workers. They were therefore often forced to spend the weeks in the city center aas four floors, including a foundation story which only faces the platform and an attic. The main stories are built in wooden vertical siding. It features a saddle roof. In its original configuration it consisted of a lower level with public facilities and an upper level with a residence.

It forms several hydrates, the most common being the pentahydrate C 6H 10CaO 6\u00b75H 2O. Calcium lactate is used in medicine, mainly to treat calcium deficiencies; and as a food additive with E number of E327. Some cheese crystals consist of calcium lactate. The lactate ion is chiral, with two enantiomers, D (\u2212,R) and L (+,S). The L isomer is the one normally synthesized and metabolized by living organisms, but some bacteria can produce the D form or convert the L to D. Thus calcium lactate also has D and L isomers, where all anions are of the same type. Some synthesis processes yield a mixture of the two in equal parts, resulting in the DL (racemic) salt. Both the L and the DL forms occur as crystals on the surface of aging Cheddar cheese.The solubility of calcium L-lactate in water increases significantly in presence of d-gluconate ions, from 6.7 g/dl) at 25 \u00b0C to 9.74 g/dl or more. Paradoxically, while the solubility of calcium L-lactate increases with temperature from 10 \u00b0C (4.8 g/dl) to 30 \u00b0C (8.5 g/dl), the concentration of free Ca2+ ions decreases by almost one half. This is explained as the lactate and calcium ions becoming less hydrated and forming a complex C 3H 5O 3Ca+. The DL (racemic) form of the salt is much less soluble in water than the pure L or D isomers, so that a solution that contains as little as 25% of the D form will deposit racemic DL-lactate crystals instead of L-lactate. The pentahydrate loses water in a dry atmosphere between 35 and 135 \u00b0C, being reduced to the anhydrous form and losing its crystalline character. The process is reversed at 25 \u00b0C and 75% relative humidity.<PIC> Calcium lactate can be prepared by the reaction of lactic acid with calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide. Since the 19th century, the salt has been obtained industrially by fermentation of carbohydrates in theolecular gastronomy as a flavorless fat-soluble agent for plain and reverse spherification. It reacts with sodium alginate to form a skin around the food item. Calcium lactate may be added to animal rations as a source of calcium. The compound was formerly an intermediate in the preparation of lactic acid for food and medical uses. The impure acid from various sources was converted to calcium lactate, purified by crystallization, and then converted back to acid by treatment with sulfuric acid, which precipitated the calcium as calcium sulfate. This method yielded a purer product than would be obtained by distillation of the original acid. Recently ammonium lactate has been used as an alternative to calcium in this process. Calcium lactate has been considered as a coagulant for removing suspended solids from water, as a renewable, non-toxic, and biodegradable alternative to aluminum chloride AlCl 3. Addition of calcium lactate substantially increases the compressive strength and reduces water permeability of bioconcrete, by enabling bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cohnii, Bacillus pseudofirmus and Sporosarcina pasteurii to produce more calcite.", "images": ["w_s1745"], "tokens": 850}]}

It is composed of the frass of the insect and often its exuviae, or bits of shed exoskeleton. The beetle may carry the shield on its back or wield it upon its posterior end. The main function of the fecal shield is defense against predators. Other terms for the fecal shield noted in the literature include \"larval clothing\", \"kotanhang\" (\"fecal appendage\"), \"faecal mask\", \"faecal pad\", and \"exuvio-faecal annex\". Beetle larvae of the chrysomelid subfamilies Criocerinae and Galerucinae often wear their fecal shields in piles on their backs, regularly adding material as bits chip off. The shields of Cassidinae larvae are mobile. They are attached to the posterior end of the body and moved into position as needed, sometimes held in place above the larva like an umbrella. They may be raised and even swung to strike a predator.When the shield is carried on the tip of the abdomen, it is secured to a double-lobed, spine-like process called the caudal furca, which is also known as the \"anal fork\". The larva constructs the shield by maneuvering its \"muscular telescopic and highly protrusible anus\", or \"anal turret\", which is positioned dorsally, on the back. It excretes an amount of feces, sometimes with a droplet of gluey secretion, and places it on the caudal furca using its anal turret. In the species Hemisphaerota cyanea, the larva constructs a shield which may be more descriptively called a \"fecal thatch\", because it is woven from narrow, coiled strands of frass. The larva begins feeding immediately upon emergence from the egg and within minutes it produces its first fecal strand. Within twelve hours, its thatch-shield is full-sized. The larva diligently repairs the shield with replacement strands when it is broken. The fecal shield takes many forms across species. In some, it covers the entire body, while in others it is narrower. In some, it is simply a \"clump\". In consistency it may be hard or rather \"pasty\". In some species of the subfamily Chrysomelinae, the female adult coats each of her eggs with feces, and when the larva emerges, it uses this ready-made fecal casing as the base of its shield, adding to it as it grows. These casings tend to be quite hard, and have been compared to adobe. Most fecal shields are bound with exuviae, the \"skins\" shed from the insect when it molts. Some shields, such as that of Cassida stigmatica, are entirely frass-free, made only of exuviae.<PIC> The fecal shield is not just a physical barrier, but also a chemical one. When a larva feeds on a plant, it ingests secondary metabolites in the plant tissues, such as alkaloids, saponins, and phytol derivatives, and these are present in its feces. These chemicals can be a potent defense against predatory insects.For example, the larva of the tortoise beetle Plagiometriona clavata obtains chemical compounds from its diet of bittersweet (Solanum dulcamara), excretes them, and incorporates them into its shield, where they repel the predatory ant Formica subsericea. The fecal shield is beneficial, but it is not without its cost to the insect. Though it is made of waste products, the larva must exert energy simply to transport its weight. A fecal shield can weigh half as much as the larva itself. This energy might otherwise go into development. The shield is also a problem for the larva when it has the opposite effect: its chemistry attracts predators instead of repelling them. Experiments with several larvae of genus Cassida that feed on volatile-rich tansy show that their shields attract the predatory ant Myrmica rubra. Another possible function of the fecal shield may include protection of the larva from environmental conditions such as ultraviolet radiation, desiccation, wind, and rain.", "images": ["w_s1774"], "tokens": 1041}]}

The syndrome is also called the syndrome of doubles of the self, delusion of subjective doubles, or simply subjective doubles. Sometimes, the patient is under the impression that there is more than one double. A double may be projected onto any person, from a stranger to a family member. This syndrome is often diagnosed during or after the onset of another mental disorder, such as schizophrenia or other disorders involving psychotic hallucinations. There is no widely accepted method of treatment, as most patients require individualized therapy. The prevalence of this disease is relatively low, as few cases have been reported since the disease was defined in 1978 by George Nikolaos Christodoulou (b.1935), a Greek-American Psychiatrist. However, subjective doubles is not clearly defined in literature, and therefore may be under-reported. The symptoms of the syndrome of subjective doubles are not clearly defined in medical literature; however, there are some defining features of the delusion: The existence of the delusion, by definition, is not a widely accepted cultural belief.The patient insists that the double he/she sees is real even when presented with contradictory evidence. Paranoia and/or spatial visualization ability impairments are present. Similarities to other disorders are often noted in literature. Prosopagnosia, or the inability to recognize faces, may be related to this disorder due to the similarity of symptoms. Subjective doubles syndrome is also similar to delusional autoscopy, also known as an out-of-body experience, and therefore is occasionally referred to as an autoscopic type delusion. However, subjective doubles delusion differs from an autoscopic delusion: autoscopy often occurs during times of extreme stress, and can usually be treated by relieving the said stressor. The syndrome of subjective doubles is usually accompanied by another mental disorder or organic brain syndrome, and may appear during or after the onset of the other disorder. Often, co-occurrence of subjective doubles with other types of delusional misidentification syndromes, especially Capgras syndrome, also occurs. Several variations of the syndrome have been reported in literature: The doubles may appear at different ages of oneself. Some patients describe their double as both a physically and psychologically identical copy, rather than a purely physical copy. This is also known as clonal pluralization of the self, another type of delusional misidentification syndrome that may or may not be the same type of disorder (see #Controversy, below). In this case, depersonalization may be a symptom. Reverse subjective doubles occurs when the patient believes his/her own self (either physical or mental) is being transformed into another person. (see the case of Mr. A in #Presentation) Taken from Kamanitz et al., 1989: \"Mrs. B. is a 50-year-old white married homemaker and the mother of five children with three previous psychiatric hospitalizations for depression and bipolar illness.[...] She firmly believed that another Mrs. B. existed who had replaced herself in her husband's affections. [...] Mrs. B. was convinced that the 'grooves in her fingers were smoother,' and that the double had taken her fingerprints. She was so concerned about the existence of another Mrs. B. that she required the constant presence of her driver's license to reassure herself that she was the real Mrs. B. In addition to her delusional belief, Mrs. B. reported that she had actually seen the other Mrs. B. She believed that the other Mrs. B. was also a patient in the unit who looked exactly like her facially but was heavier in the body. (Another, younger, patient, who was pregnant, was actuallythe person upon whom this illusion was superimposed.)\" The following case describes a patient who has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder along with multiple delusional misidentification syndromes (subjective doubles, Capgras delusion, intermetamorphosis): Taken from Silva et al., 1994: \"Mr. B believed that five physical copies of himself existed. Each copy had a different mind than his own. On one occasion, he thought himself to have been Jesus Christ, but denied having undergone any bodily changes. Mr. B stated that five replicas of the city in which he lived existed as well as the existence of five different planet earths. He, however, acknowledged having lived on only one of these earths. Mr. B had a history of several arrests for attacking police officers, whom he believed were impostor replicas of real police officers.\" The following case describes a patient who has been diagnosed with chronic paranoid schizophrenia and reverse subjective doubles: Taken from Vasavada and Masand, 1992: \"Mr. A, a 40-year-old divorced white male, was hospitalized for his complaint that his identity had been changed in the last six years. He stated that he was not Mr. A but Mr.B and preferred to be called by that name. [...] When asked to describe Mr. B, he replied that the only thing he remembered was that Mr. B was an orphan and had made his fortune by working hard. He denied that Mr. B had any family members. He would get angry when addressed as Mr. A and would insist on being called Mr. B. [...] In the above case our patient believed that he had been changed both physically (face, fingerprints, etc.) and psychologically (he could recount details of his life as Mr. A but few as Mr. B).\" Subjective doubles is commonly comorbid with other psychiatric illnesses, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. The cause of the disorder is difficult to ascertain not only because of its rarity, but also due to the simultaneous presence of other disorders. While the physiological cause of the syndrome of subjective doubles has not been found, many hypotheses exist. Some researchers believe that the syndrome of subjective doubles appears as a symptom of another disorder instead of a disorder of its own. (see #Controversy, below) The syndrome of subjective doubles may also be related to substance dependence. Another hypothesis states that subjective doubles is result of hyper-identification, linked to over-activity in certain areas of the brain, thereby causing the patient see familiar aspects of the self in strangers. Some hypothesize that this delusion is a result of facial processing deficiencies, as it has seemingly similar symptoms of prosopagnosia; however, recognition of most faces is impaired in this delusion. Facial processing deficiencies also do not account for the occasion in which multiple doubles are reported. Another hypothesis is that a \"disconnection\" between the right and left hemispheres may cause the delusional symptoms. This hypothesis relies heavily on the theory of lateralization of brain function, or left brain vs. right brain theory. In this hypothesis, the inability of the right hemisphere to \"check\" the left hemisphere causes the individual to succumb to delusions of self-awareness created by the left hemisphereThis is also known as clonal pluralization of the self, another less common delusion that is grouped with the other delusional misidentification syndromes.", "images": ["w_s1812"], "tokens": 1727}]}

She was built for the Kriegsmarine as the weather ship and icebreaker Externsteine. The ship was captured on 16 October 1944 by USCGC Eastwind of the Greenland Patrol and was temporarily commissioned into the United States Coast Guard as USCGC East Breeze before being turned over to the United States Navy and commissioned as USS Callao in January 1945. The ship was sold out of service in 1950, and broken up the following year. The ship was 183 feet (55.78 m) long, with a beam of 30 feet 10 inches (9.40 m) and a draught of 13 feet 11 inches (4.24 m). She had a displacement of 1,015 tons. She was powered by a 750 shp triple expansion steam engine with an exhaust turbine driving a single screw propeller, which could propel her at 10 knots (19 km/h). The ship was built in 1943\u201344 as yard number 570 by P. Smit, Jr. Shipyard, Rotterdam, South Holland, Netherlands.Originally intended to be the trawler Mannheim for the Nordsee Deutsche Hochseefischerei, Weserm\u00fcnde, she was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine as Externsteine. She was launched in 1944, and completed in July of that year. The ship was originally named for the unusual Externsteine rock formation investigated by Heinrich Himmler for evidence of cultural significance to early Teutonic folklore and history. Externsteine had the identification number WBS 11. Her complement was nineteen crew plus eleven meteorologists. She was employed as a weather observation ship off Shannon Island on the northeast coast of Greenland to aid forecasting of storm events tactically significant to North Atlantic and European combat operations, but was captured on the night of 15 October\u201316 October 1944 by the American icebreaker USCGC Eastwind. On 2 October, a Grumman J2F Duck aircraft from USCGC Eastwind spotted a trawler camouflaged in a field of unconsolidated pack ice off North Little Koldewey Island, where the Germans had set up a weather station. The camouflaged ship was visible on the aircraft's radar. Personnel from USCGC Eastwind captured the twelve crew of the weather station on 4 October. Documents captured revealed that the ship that they had spotted was the Externsteine, which was apparently escorted by a U-boat. The search for Externsteine was delayed by the weather, but on 14 October she was found trapped in ice 10 nautical miles (19 km) off Cape Borgen. At 21:00 on 15 November, USCGC Eastwind located Externsteine at a range of 7 nautical miles (13 km) of her radar, and \"battle stations\" was ordered. Captain Thomas decided to attack at a range of 2 nautical miles (3.7 km), USCGC Southwind was also present, and illuminated the target with her searchlight. At a range of 4,000 yards (3,700 m), the icebreaker fired three salvos from its 5\"/38 guns (one short, one over and one across the bow). The shots landed around the vessel, and the Germans used their blinker light to transmit the message \"We give up\" in English. The reply, sent back in German, was \"Do not scuttle ship\".Both icebreakers approached the ship, and the surrender was formally accepted. It was discovered that scuttling charges had been placed in the ship, but these were disarmed with the assistance of Externsteine's engineering officer. Her three officers were taken back on board the vessel during the disarming as a way of guaranteeing that the ship would not be scuttled. The captain of Externsteine later told his captors that he thought the attack was being carried out by tanks, and he was amazed that the ships could break through the ice at the speed they did. He opined that the Americans would have to scuttle his ship as it was trapped in the ice. Externsteine was renamed East Breeze by her captors. However, by using explosives on the ice, the ship was freed. A prize crew of 36 men from both icebreakers soon had the ship under way. At the time, it was the northernmost combat operation ever undertaken by United States forces. Externsteine was the only enemy surface vessel captured by United States naval forces during World War II. The prize crew brought her into Boston, Massachusetts, by way of Reykjav\u00edk and Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. On 30 November, she was involved in a collision with USCGC Travis. At Boston, she was commissioned into the United States Navy on 24 January 1945, with Lieutenant D. O. Newton, USNR, in command. Between 30 January 1945 and 4 February she was outfitted at Philadelphia Navy Yard for special experimental work for the U.S Navy Bureau of Ships, and for the next five years carried out tests in the area of Cape May, New Jersey, and Cape Henlopen, Delaware.

This staining technique is an equivalent of the indirect immunofluorescence technique for visible light. Colloidal gold particles are most often attached to secondary antibodies which are in turn attached to primary antibodies designed to bind a specific antigen or other cell component. Gold is used for its high electron density which increases electron scatter to give high contrast 'dark spots'. First used in 1971, immunogold labeling has been applied to both transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, as well as brightfield microscopy. The labeling technique can be adapted to distinguish multiple objects by using differently-sized gold particles. Immunogold labeling can introduce artifacts, as the gold particles reside some distance from the labelled object and very thin sectioning is required during sample preparation. Immunogold labeling was first used in 1971 by Faulk and Taylor to identify Salmonella antigens. It was first applied in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and was especially useful in highlighting proteins found in low densities, such as some cell surface antigens.As the resolution of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) increased, so too did the need for nanoparticle-sized labels such as immunogold. In 1975, Horisberger and coworkers successfully visualised gold nanoparticles with a diameter of less than 30 nm and this soon became an established SEM technique. First, a thin section of the sample is cut, often using a microtome. Various other stages of sample preparation may then take place. The prepared sample is then incubated with a specific antibody designed to bind the molecule of interest. Next, a secondary antibody which has gold particles attached is added, and it binds to the primary antibody. Gold can also be attached to protein A or protein G instead of a secondary antibody, as these proteins bind mammalian IgG Fc regions in a non-specific way. The electron-dense gold particle can now be seen under an electron microscope as a black dot, indirectly labeling the molecule of interest. Immunogold labeling can be used to visualize more than one target simultaneously. This can be achieved in electron microscopy by using two different-sized gold particles. An extension of this method used three different sized gold particles to track the localisation of regulatory peptides. A more complex method of multi-site labeling involves labeling opposite sides of an antigenic site separately, the immunogold particles attached to both sides can then be viewed simultaneously. Although immunogold labeling is typically used for transmission electron microscopy, when the gold is'silver-enhanced' it can be seen using brightfield microscopy. The silver enhancement increases the particle size, also making scanning electron microscopy possible. In order to produce the silver-enhanced gold particles, colloidal gold particles are placed in an acidic enhancing solution containing silver ions. Gold particles then act as a nucleation site and silver is deposited onto the particle.An example of the application of silver-enhanced immunogold labeling (IGSS) was in the identification of the pathogen Erwinia amylovora.<PIC> An inherent limitation to the immunogold technique is that the gold particle is around 15-30 nm away from the site to which the primary antibody is bound (when using a primary and secondary antibodies labeling strategy). The precise location of the targeted molecule can therefore not be accurately calculated. Gold particles can be created with a diameter of 1 nm (or lower) but another limitation is then realized\u2014at these sizes the gold label becomes hard to distinguish from tissue structure. Thin sections are required for immunogold labeling and these can produce misleading images; a thin slice of a cell component may not give an accurate view of its three-dimensional structure. For example, a microtubule may appear as a'spike' depending on which plane the sectioning occurred. To overcome this limitation serial sections can be taken, which can then be compiled into a three-dimensional image. A further limitation is that antibodies and gold particles cannot penetrate the resin used to embed samples for imaging. Thus, only accessible molecules can be targeted and visualized. Labeling prior to embedding the sample can reduce the negative impact of this limitation.", "images": ["w_s1826"], "tokens": 1043}]}

Probably the earliest fulling mill in Saddleworth, Walk Mill would have been a common meeting place for the local clothiers.

The species has developed a method of foraging and storing the grass it collects near the surface of the mounds. Because they rely on open cover foraging, which in winter might be unavailable, and unlike most species of termite they store their food to avoid leaving the mound when the cold makes this difficult.

They include a regional park, the Parco Naturale dei Monti Aurunci, created in 1997. The mountains take the name from the ancient tribe of the Aurunci, an offshoot of the Ausoni.Both tribes were derived from the Italic people who were called by the Romans the Volsci; hence, the Monti Lepini, the Monti Ausoni and the Monti Aurunci are also called the Volsci or Volscian Chain.

Torque multipliers are often used instead of extended handles, often called \"cheater bars\". Extended handles use leverage instead of gear reduction to achieve torque. This torque is transmitted through the driving tool and could become dangerous in the case of a sudden catastrophic failure of the drive tool with the extended handle attached. Torque multipliers only have a fraction of the final torque pressure on the drive tool making them a safer choice. Torque multipliers typically employ an epicyclic gear train having one or more stages. Each stage of gearing multiplies the torque applied. In epicyclic gear systems, torque is applied to the input gear or \u2018sun\u2019 gear. A number of planet gears are arranged around and engaged with this sun gear, and therefore rotate. The outside casing of the multiplier is also engaged with the planet gear teeth, but is prevented from rotating by means of a reaction arm, causing the planet gears to orbit around the sun gear. The planet gears are held in a \u2018planet carrier' which also holds the output drive shaft.As the planet gears orbit around the sun gear, the carrier and the output shaft rotate together. Without the reaction arm to prevent rotation of the outer casing, the output shaft cannot apply torque. Along with the multiplication of torque, there is a decrease in rotational speed of the output shaft compared to the input shaft. This decrease in speed is inversely proportional to the increase in torque. For example, a torque multiplier with a rating of 3:1 will turn its output shaft with three times the torque, but at one third the speed, of the input shaft. However, due to friction and other inefficiencies in the mechanism, the output torque is slightly lower than the theoretical output.<PIC> Torque multipliers are most often used when a compressed air powered impact wrench is unavailable due to remote locations without power, or where cost considerations require manually operated tools which do not require any power supply or power source of any kind. There are many instances where screws, bolts and other fasteners are secured so tightly that using a typical lug wrench with a cheater bar is not sufficient to loosen them. These include automotive repair, product assembly, construction projects, heavy equipment maintenance and other instances where high torque output is needed. A torque multiplier allows the user to generate high torque output without the use of an air compressor or impact gun. A torque multiplier is generally used when there are space limitations that disallow the use of long handles. They are also used as a safer alternative to a cheater bar as lever length and operator effort are both reduced. Finally, torque multipliers allow for more accurate torque. By reducing the amount of effort needed to tighten, a torque multiplier allows for slow and smooth application, ensuring more accurate torque levels, and preventing damage to sensitive components.", "images": ["w_s1901"], "tokens": 727}]}

Since a power grid requires that generation and load closely balance moment by moment, frequent adjustments to the output of generators are necessary. The balance can be judged by measuring the system frequency; if it is increasing, more power is being generated than used, which causes all the machines in the system to accelerate. If the system frequency is decreasing, more load is on the system than the instantaneous generation can provide, which causes all generators to slow down. Before the use of automatic generation control, one generating unit in a system would be designated as the regulating unit and would be manually adjusted to control the balance between generation and load to maintain system frequency at the desired value. The remaining units would be controlled with speed droop to share the load in proportion to their ratings. With automatic systems, many units in a system can participate in regulation, reducing wear on a single unit's controls and improving overall system efficiency, stability, and economy. Where the grid has tie interconnections to adjacent control areas, automatic generation control helps maintain the power interchanges over the tie lines at the scheduled levels.With computer-based control systems and multiple inputs, an automatic generation control system can take into account such matters as the most economical units to adjust, the coordination of thermal, hydroelectric, and other generation types, and even constraints related to the stability of the system and capacity of interconnections to other power grids. Turbine generators in a power system have stored kinetic energy due to their large rotating masses. All the kinetic energy stored in a power system in such rotating masses is a part of the grid inertia. When system load increases, grid inertia is initially used to supply the load. This, however, leads to a decrease in the stored kinetic energy of the turbine generators. Since the mechanical power of these turbines correlates with the delivered electrical power, the turbine generators have a decrease in angular velocity, which is directly proportional to a decrease in frequency in synchronous generators. The purpose of the turbine-governor control (TGC) is to maintain the desired system frequency by adjusting the mechanical power output of the turbine. These controllers have become automated and at steady state, the frequency-power relation for turbine-governor control is, \\Delta p_m = \\Delta p_{ref} - 1/R\\times\\Delta f where, \\Delta p_m is the change in turbine mechanical power output \\Delta p_{ref} is the change in a reference power setting R = -\\Delta f/\\Delta p_m = -slope is the regulation constant which quantifies the sensitivity of the generator to a change in frequency \\Delta f is the change in frequency.For steam turbines, steam turbine governing adjusts the mechanical output of the turbine by increasing or decreasing the amount of steam entering the turbine via a throttle valve.<PIC> Load-frequency control (LFC) is employed to allow an area to first meet its own load demands, then to assist in returning the steady-state frequency of the system, \u0394f, to zero. Load-frequency control operates with a response time of a few seconds to keep system frequency stable. The goal of economic dispatch is to minimize total operating costs in an area by determining how the real power output of each generating unit will meet a given load. Generating units have different costs to produce a unit of electrical energy, and incur different costs for the losses in transmitting energy to the load. An economic dispatch algorithm will run every few minutes to select the combination of generating unit power setpoints that minimizes overall cost, subject to the constraints of transmission limitation or security of the system against failures. Further constraints may be imposed by the water supply of hydroelectric generation, or by the availability of sun and wind power.", "images": ["w_s1918"], "tokens": 977}]}

Wetlands are characterized by water-logged soils and distinctive communities of plant and animal species that have evolved and adapted to the constant presence of water. This high level of water saturation creates conditions conducive to methane production. Most methanogenesis, or methane production, occurs in oxygen-poor environments. Because the microbes that live in warm, moist environments consume oxygen more rapidly than it can diffuse in from the atmosphere, wetlands are the ideal anaerobic environments for fermentation as well as methanogen activity. However, levels of methanogenesis can fluctuate as it is dependent on the availability of oxygen, temperature of the soil, and the composition of the soil; a warmer, more anaerobic environment with soil rich in organic matter would allow for more efficient methanogenesis. Fermentation is a process used by certain kinds of microorganisms to break down essential nutrients.In a process called acetoclastic methanogenesis, microorganisms from the classification domain archaea produce methane by fermenting acetate and H2-CO2 into methane and carbon dioxide. H3C-COOH \u2192 CH4 + CO2 Depending on the wetland and type of archaea, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, another process that yields methane, can also occur. This process occurs as a result of archaea oxidizing hydrogen with carbon dioxide to yield methane and water. 4H2 + CO2 \u2192 CH4 + 2H2O Wetlands are often classified by landscape position, vegetation, and hydrologic regime. Wetland classes include marshes, swamps, bogs, fens, peatlands, muskegs, prairie pothole (landform), and pocosins; characteristics of wetland classes can assist to inform on magnitude of methane emissions. However, wetland classes have displayed high variability in methane emissions spatially and temporally. Once produced, methane can reach the atmosphere via three main pathways: molecular diffusion, transport through plant aerenchyma, and ebullition. Primary productivity fuels methane emissions both directly and indirectly because plants not only provide much of the carbon needed for methane producing processes in wetlands but can affect its transport as well. Diffusion through the profile refers to the movement of methane up through soil and bodies of water to reach the atmosphere. The importance of diffusion as a pathway varies per wetland based on the type of soil and vegetation. For example, in peatlands, the mass amount of dead, but not decaying, organic matter results in relatively slow diffusion of methane through the soil. Additionally, because methane can travel more quickly through soil than water, diffusion plays a much bigger role in wetlands with drier, more loosely compacted soil. Plant aerenchyma refers to the vessel-like transport tubes within the tissues of certain kinds of plants. Plants with aerenchyma possess porous tissue that allows for direct travel of gases to and from the plant roots. Methane can travel directly up from the soil into the atmosphere using this transport system.The direct \"shunt\" created by the aerenchyma allows for methane to bypass oxidation by oxygen that is also transported by the plants to their roots.<PIC> Ebullition refers to the sudden release of bubbles of methane into the air. These bubbles occur as a result of methane building up over time in the soil, forming pockets of methane gas. As these pockets of trapped methane grow in size, the level of the soil will slowly rise up as well. This phenomenon continues until so much pressure builds up that the bubble \"pops,\" transporting the methane up through the soil so quickly that it does not have time to be consumed by the methanotrophic organisms in the soil. With this release of gas, the level of soil then falls once more. Ebullition in wHowever, as a result of draining, water saturated ditches develop, which due to the warm, moist environment, end up emitting a large amount of methane. Therefore, the actual effect on methane emission strongly ends up depending on several factors. If the drains are not spaced far enough apart, then saturated ditches will form, creating mini wetland environments. Additionally, if the water table is lowered significantly enough, then the wetland can actually be transformed from a source of methane into a sink that consumes methane. Finally, the actual composition of the original wetland changes how the surrounding environment is affected by the draining and human development.", "images": ["w_s1923"], "tokens": 1129}]}

Although painfully wounded by fragments from an enemy mortar shell while leading his evacuation platoon in support of assault units attacking a cleverly concealed and well-entrenched hostile force occupying commanding ground, Second Lieutenant MURPHY steadfastly refused medical aid and continued to lead his men up a hill through a withering barrage of hostile mortar and small-armsfire, skillfully maneuvering his force from one position to the next and shouting words of encouragement. Undeterred by the increasing intense enemy fire, he immediately located casualties as they fell and made several trips up and down the fire-swept hill to direct evacuation teams to the wounded, personally carrying many of the stricken Marines to safety. When reinforcements were needed by the assaulting elements, Second Lieutenant MURPHY employed part of his Unit as support and, during the ensuing battle, personally killed two of the enemy with his pistol. When all the wounded evacuated and the assaulting units beginning to disengage, he remained behind with a carbine to cover the movement of friendly forces off the hill and, though suffering intense pain from his previous wounds, seized an automatic rifle to provide more firepower when the enemy reappeared in the trenches. After reaching the base of the hill, he organized a search party and again ascended the slope for a final check on missing Marines, locating and carrying the bodies of a machine-gun crew back down the hill.Wounded a second time while conducting the entire force to the line of departure through a continuing barrage of enemy small-arms, artillery and mortar fire, he again refused medical assistance until assured that every one of his men, including all casualties, had preceded him to the main lines. His resolute and inspiring leadership, exceptional fortitude and great personal valor reflect the highest credit upon Second Lieutenant MURPHY and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service. /S/ DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER<PIC> Citation: The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Second Lieutenant Raymond Gerald Murphy (MCSN: 0-54837), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity as a Platoon Commander of Company A, First Battalion, Fifth Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 22 November 1952. Assigned the extremely hazardous mission of assaulting a strong point of the enemy main line of resistance, Second Lieutenant Murphy courageously exposed himself to devastating enemy mortar and artillery fire to press the assault on the objective. On three separate occasions, when the enemy attempted to prevent him from accomplishing his mission, he skillfully coordinated and utilized supporting arms to repulse the foe. Although the platoon suffered severe casualties by the time the objective was reached, the unit succeeded in evacuating the wounded in the face of continuous enemy fire. Upon successful completion of the mission, he ordered the withdrawal and personally remained behind until assured that all of his men had withdrawn. By his outstanding courage, superb leadership and indomitable spirit, Second Lieutenant Murphy served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.", "images": ["w_s1932"], "tokens": 1639}]}

Named after the hamlet of Privett, the station was in fact over half a mile (1 kilometre) from its namesake and was built in largely uninhabited countryside. Opened on 1 June 1903 north of the village a few yards east of the Alton road, its only minor claim to fame was that it caused Privett Halt in Gosport to be renamed to avoid confusion. This followed an earlier dispute over the exact name of the station. It was originally to be named 'West Tisted', following the convention that stations were named after the parish they were in. The family that owned Basing Park, the country estate on the edge of which the station was sited, insisted on the station being named Privett after the hamlet that formed part of their estate. This matter, coupled to the station being sited far from any local settlements but close to the Basing Park house, led many to conclude that the station was built specifically for the owners of the Park. The fact that a new Carriage Drive was built leading from the house to the station only led credence to this rumour.Like all the stations on the line Privett station accommodated double railway track and long platforms capable of serving 11-coach express trains. The large station buildings, designed by T. P. Figgis, were situated on the 'Down' platform and built in a highly regarded Tudor Revival style.

The Meon Valley Railway was a particularly difficult line to construct (It cost the equivalent of 27 million GBP, and took 6 years to build the 22-miles of line. Its most dramatic feature was the 1,000 yards (910 m) Privett tunnel, the northern entrance of which was close to the station. The station was also the summit of the line, at 519 feet (158 m) above sea level. Given the station's remote location passenger numbers never matched the extensive facilities. In 1921, following the Meon Valley line's downgrading from a through route to a local line (see the line's main article for more information) the 'Up' platform was closed, as was the signal box, which remained in use purely to control the goods yard. All trains now called alongside the main station buildings on the former 'Down' platform. The station remained at 'half capacity' for the next 34 years. On 7 February 1955 the station was closed (along with West Meon and Tisted stations) and all services were withdrawn. The last special train to call at the station was on 6 February 1955 when an enthusiast's special called 'The Hampshireman' briefly stopped at the station (which officially closed the next day).The station became a private house. The platform canopy was removed during conversion. Until the 1970s a fish pond occupied the former track space between the platforms but this has since been filled in.<PIC> Following the opening of the railway a public house and hotel was built across the Alton-Gosport road from the station. This was initially named 'The Privett Bush' (a pun on the common plant named Privet). The hotel is still in business, now named 'The Angel'. ", "images": ["w_s1963"], "tokens": 872}]}

He is known as \"The king of hearts\" and \"The legend of pop\" in Iran. He graduated from Tehran Industrial School of Art in 1958. Before starting his career as a singer, Aref worked as a teacher in Qazvin industrial school of art for two years, but the truth is that he has been singing since he was 12 years old. In the 1960s, Aref introduced a new wave of romantic styles to the large spectrum of romantic Persian music. After the Islamic revolution Aref left Iran and went to London and Los Angeles. He has one son and four daughters. His first hit was \"Daryacheye Noor\" which is still popular among all the Iranians. Aref and his family left Iran in 1979, following the Islamic revolution. He first lived in London, England, for three years, then moved to Los Angeles, United States.Number of songs : I present you (August 2018), that's enough (June 2018), Peshmerga (February 2017), who better than you (November 2016), Love (July 2016), Bagh-e Darya (February 2016), Mondgar (December 2015), Don't Cry (January 1, 2015), Song of Nostalgia (June 2014), Love (May 19, 2014), Storm (October 1, 2013), Aramesh (2012), If you're not (with Reza Naderi- 2011), Stars, Fire (2007), Persian Gulf. Song Style: In the past, Aref's work was known among music pursuers as \"Aref style.\". The process of shaping this style was as follows: In the mid-1940s, songs were performed as ballads that had Arabic themes and were mostly needles and gloomy. The course was attended by singers Qasim Jebeli, Manouchehr Shafiee, Alfred Lazarian and Houshang Shokati. Some poets and translators translated the lyrics of the European song \"Wow to Wow\". Hamid Ghanbari and Jamshid Sheibani were among the first to perform the translated lyrics with the same original song. This style was pop, but it was not Iranian. In the early 1950s, love songs were performed with Western orchestration and Persian theology. This style of songs was presented to the public by Mohammad Noori, Vigen and Manouchehr Sakhaei. When Aref started his career, Viguen was referred to as the \"founder of pop music\". He was able to create a \"Aref style\" by adding Iranian melodies and musical instruments to the previous style. The concept of songs : Love Songs Aref had suffered many hardships in his life, so there was a \"disdain\" in his voice. His loneliness also made the songs he sang more palpable to the listener, and the sense of the song conveyed well. This was lost by performing the song \"Lake of Light (= Daryache ye Noor)\", and he had to use his thoughts to create it in his songs to create sense. (Aref never used smoke or alcohol) Shahbal Shab-pareh wrote in \"The Pop Fader song\" about Aref: \"The Sultan(=King) of Hearts was Aref, reading it was for the heart of love.Everything he read smelled of love, promising, friendship and compromise\" Political and Patriotic Songs : With the outbreak of the revolution, Aref tried to distance himself from singing love songs and sing about the pains of the people of his community. During his time in the country, he performed the songs of \"brother (=baradar)\" and \"I will give you my hands (= dast hayam raa be to midaham)\". Abroad, songs such as \"My Pulse for Iran (=nabze man baraye Iran mizane)\", \"People Always people (=mardom hamishe mardom)\", \"Little Soldier (=sarbaz kochoolo)\", \"Blackout (=khaamooshi)\", \"Strange Days of Nazanin(= roozegare ajibist nazanin)\", \"Beman Madar\", \"khakeh man Irane man Koo\", \"Anthem of Iran (Polyphony)\", \"Persian Gulf(=khalije fars)\", \"Beat the Fire(= bezan atash)\" released.New Persian Songs : In the early 1970s, great songwriters such as Shahyar Ghanbari, Ardalan Sarfaraz and Iraj Jannati-Ataei began to change the course of songs and used heavy Persian literature. These types of poets were like unknown 2-3 equations that led the listener astray. Aref sought to perform simple poets that would be tangible to the listener. Like the song \"I Don't Believe (=delam bavar nadareh)\" with a poem by Shahyar Ghanbari that was performed in the mid-1960s : [ I know, like everyone else, you'll be fed up with me, and you'll be saddened by my grief / These two white hands in my hand, I know, will eventually put my hand back / I know, but I don't believe it's enough that it's simple, it brings me bad back ] Polyphony Songs : 1. Duet with female singers :In addition to Narmela and Pouran and Delkash, Ramesh, Googoosh, Ahdieh, Beheshteh, Shahin, Hayedeh, Pouran Zandi (wife of Jamshid Zandi ), Aref also performed duets that were mostly made for feature films. In the 1960s and 1970s, most of the selway choruses of Aref songs were performed by a woman named Hermineh. In 2002, Aref appeared as a guest singer at the Kodak Theatre and performed the song \"Sultan of Hearts (=sultane qalbha)\" along with Leila Forouhar.Duet male singers : The songs that Aref performed with male singers are: Advice (with Amir Rasaei), Roses (with Sattar), Iran Iraneh (with Shahram Kashani) and If you're not (with Reza Naderi). In late 1991, at an art festival, baron baron, kalaghha, and Hala kheili direh, they were co-performed by Viguen, Manouchehr Sakhaei and Aref.

Featured Songs : 1. Burning and Instrument (=sooro-saze): The song is the result of Arif's collaboration with Parviz Maqsadi, which marked a turning point in his fame. Aref says: \"Early on, I sang every song I was offered, but later I decided not to play a song that didn't sit in my heart. That's why I tried my best to sing my favorite songs, and the beginning of these songs was \"Burning and Instrument\", which was welcomed by everyone. Elusive shadow (=Saaye-gorizan): The song was released in 1967 and topped the best-selling songs for weeks.The elusive shadow is based on a song by \"I saw her standing there\", whose rhythm has been transformed from two-fourth to six-eighth, and is played in the style of the \"Beatles\" with three guitars. The song's composer was Parviz Khatibi, who helped Aref and Zaven Ohanian (the arranger of the work) to transform the rhythm. \"Lake of Light (=Daryache-Noor)\": The song was performed and released in 1968 with a beautiful melody by Parviz Maqsadi. \"Daryache-Noor\" was ranked second in the best song of 1968 by the singers of \"Majale-Javanan\" ( famous Iranian journal ), which made Aref more popular. Aref's sense of satisfaction was so much that he forgot about his sadly-voice. Aref says: \"When the song \"Daryache-Noor\" was very muddy, Vigen also went to a destination to compose a song at this level, and he wrote \"Gole-sorkh\", which was highly regarded.<PIC> Aref recalls to have sung up to 850 songs to this date.ears in a row.

After refuelling there, at 11:50 eleven passengers boarded the aircraft. The next sector would have taken the Cessna to Pom Pom Camp, but it was decided to stop at Xakanaxa first to drop two passengers. No flight plan was filed for the diversion to Xakanaxa, nor was the airline's base informed. At Xakanaxa, the pilot was informed that he was required to pick up another two passengers bound for Maun.After some hesitation, the pilot agreed to take the passengers, departing from Xakanaxa with eleven passengers, despite company procedures restricting the maximum number of passengers for operations from that airfield to ten. The Grand Caravan took off from Xakanaka airstrip at 13:55. Almost immediately after take-off, the engine lost power and the aircraft collided with trees. It then crashed nose first approximately 600 metres from the airfield, with an intense fire quickly engulfing the wreckage, burning beyond recognition the bodies of six passengers and the pilot. A rescue team was flown in and found the wreckage still ablaze. An eighth occupant was taken to hospital but later died. Identification of the victims was only possible through DNA testing.

Its flagship product, Carma Carpooling, matches users with nearby commuters and enables them to share the cost of driving. Carma also has offices in San Francisco, California and Austin, Texas. Formerly known as Avego, the company was founded in 2007 by Sean O'Sullivan as a research and development division of the company Mapflow. In April 2009, Avego became a separate entity associated with University College Cork. Its real-time carpooling service first served the University community in the form of an iPhone application, with seats priced by mileage. In January 2011, Avego and the Washington State Department of Transportation launched a pilot carpool program, called \"go520,\" serving the Washington State Route 520 corridor outside Seattle. Financial subsidies of $30 monthly were available to both drivers and riders for the duration of the pilot. In October 2011, Avego began a carpooling pilot in the Arlington Potomac Yard area. In mid-2012, Avego implemented the largest carpooling project to date in Santa Barbara, Sonoma County, Contra Costa County, and Marin County, California. It was administered by Caltrans and the MTC.In August 2013, the company changed its name to Carma, unveiling a new corporate identity in the process. In February 2014, Carma introduced an automated tolling discount program for carpoolers in Austin, Texas, in conjunction with the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority (CTRMA). After unprecedented success, the tolling initiative then expanded to Austin's Manor Expressway in May 2014. In June 2014, Carma opened up its API to third-party developers and unveiled the Carma Prize Fund \u2013 a $2.5m stimulus program aimed at boosting ridesharing activity around the world. Carma produces real-time information and management systems that use GPS, GSM, Geographic Information Systems, Internet and iPhone technologies to facilitate a shift fromsingle-occupancy vehicles to sustainable transport. Carma's flagship product is a carpooling app that matches drivers and riders, enabling people to make car transportation more efficient and affordable. The company states on its website that Carma's mission is \"to enable people around the world to break free from the tyranny of the modern commute\".<PIC> According to the Carma Terms of service, proceeds of the rider(s) payment (consisting of fixed charge per trip and a variable per mile fee) is split between the driver (85%) and the company (15%). The company introduced its \"Shared Transport\" app at the DEMOfall 2008 conference in September 2008. It enables on-demand carpooling. It works by automatically matching a driver's spare seat capacity with a passenger's desire to travel the same route at the same time. Drivers are provided with a price incentive in the form of electronic micropayments from riders at the end of each journey. In December 2008, the iPhone app was released as a free download at Apple's App Store and was featured prominently in the New York Times and other major media outlets.

The larger breweries developed after the end of the American Civil War. Five breweries were functioning in the city: Mathias Frahm and Son, Koehler and Lange (also known as Arsenal Brewery), Littig Brothers (later Mengel and Klindt and Eagle Brewery), Julius Lehrkind's Brewery and Zoller Brothers. They all distributed their beer mainly in Davenport, Rock Island, Illinois and Moline, Illinois. Brothers Ernest, Herman and Charles Zoeller established the Zoeller Brothers Malt House in the mid-1880s in the Black Hawk area of Davenport's west end. In 1890 they reopened the Black Hawk brewery there father, Ernst Zoeller, Sr., had operated prior. In 1894 all the breweries consolidated into a single corporate structure called The Davenport Malting Company. They built this building in an industrial section of the west end that contained some of the first refrigeration equipment used in the city.nd by 1941 they grew to become the largest brewery in Iowa. They employed 250-300 people and their annual output was 150,000 barrels of beer that was distributed in nine states and in 2,000 cities. The company changed its name to the Blackhawk Brewery in 1945. It ended production in 1952 with the rise of national brands. The Uchtorff Brewing Company operated out of the facility for several years before they folded. The building has been used by United Van Lines as a warehouse in subsequent years. Plans to turn the building back into a brewery with a museum started in 2019. Andrew Arnold says that the location will have a museum in the front of the building, a pub on the main floor, a brewery in the back, and a place for local brewers to grow their craft on the second floor.

Kroehl and Ariel Patterson in Brooklyn, New York for the Pacific Pearl Company. It was hand powered and had an interconnected system of a high-pressure air chamber or compartment, a pressurized working chamber for the crew, and water ballast tanks. Problems with decompression sickness and overfishing of the pearl beds led to the abandonment of Sub Marine Explorer in Panama in 1869 despite publicized plans to shift the craft to the pearl beds of Baja California. Sub Marine Explorer had an external high air pressure chamber which was filled with compressed air at a pressure of up to 200 pounds per square inch (1,400 kPa) by a steam pump mounted on an external support vessel. Water ballast tanks were flooded to make the vessel submerge. Pressurized air was then released into the vessel to build up enough pressure so it would be possible to open two hatches on the underside, while keeping water out. This meant that air pressure inside the submarine had to equal water pressure at diving depth, exposing the crew to high pressure, making them susceptible to decompression sickness, which was unknown at the time.To surface, more of the pressurized air was used to empty the ballast tanks of water. A contemporary (August 1869) newspaper account of dives in Sub Marine Explorer off Panama documents 11 days of diving to 103 feet (31 m), spending four hours per dive, and ascending with a quick release of the pressure to ambient (sea level) pressure. Modern reconstruction of Explorer's systems suggests an ascension rate of 1 foot per second (0.30 m/s), or a rise to the surface in just under two minutes. The problems of decompression do not appear to have been clearly understood; the contemporary reference notes that at the conclusion of the dives, \"all the men were again down with fever; and, it being impossible to continue working with the same men for some time, it was decided, the experiment having proved a complete success, to lay the machine up in an adjacent cove....\"(The New York Times, August 29, 1869). The basic premise of Sub Marine Explorer was based on an earlier 1858 patent by Van Buren Ryerson of New York for a diving bell also named \"Sub Marine Explorer.\" Ryerson and Kroehl had worked together, Kroehl using Ryerson's bell to blast and partially clear Diamond Reef in New York harbor. Kroehl, working with Brooklyn shipbuilder Ariel Patterson, extensively modified Ryerson's design, extending the hull form to a 12 m-long (39 ft), 3.3 m-diameter (11 ft) craft of intricate design. While some have termed Kroehl's Sub Marine Explorer a \"glorified diving bell,\" its sophisticated systems of ballast, pressurization and propulsion make it a nineteenth-century antecedent to more modern \"lock out\" dive systems and subs. After construction, the Sub Marine Explorer was partially disassembled and transported to Panama in December 1866, where she was reassembled to harvest oysters and pearls in the Pearl Islands.Experimental dives with the Sub Marine Explorer in the Bay of Panama ended in September 1867 when Kroehl died of \"fever\". The craft languished on the beach until 1869, when a new engineer and crew took it to the Pearl Islands to harvest oyster shells and pearls. The 1869 dives, with known depths and dive profiles that would have inevitably led to decompression sickness, resulted in the entire crew succumbing to what was described as \"fever\". Because of this, the craft was laid up in a cove on the shores of the island of San Telmo in the Pearl Islands. The submarine's rusting hull was well-known to locals, but they had presumed it to be a remnant of World War II. In 2001, after many years of misidentification, the remains of the Sub Marine Explorer piqued the interest of archaeologist James P. Delgado of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology. Identification of the craft, with the assistance of submarine historians Richard Wills and Eugene Canfield, led to four archaeological expeditions to the Explorer in 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008. Documentation of the Sub Marine Explorer has resulted in detailed plans, including interpretive reconstructions of the craft, scientific study of its environment and interaction with the surrounding water, bathymetric assessment, scientific analysis of rates of corrosion, and considerable historical research. Work in 2006 was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through the Office of Ocean Exploration. The 2008 expedition was funded by the Waitt Institute for Discovery of La Jolla. The vessel is now included in the Historic American Engineering Record of the U.S. National Park Service. A report from 2007 summarizes preservation options for the submarine for the Panamanian government and recommends the recovery, preservation and public display of the craft in Panama. Metal analysis confirms that the craft is in a critical stage and faces irreversible deterioration and loss. The Sub Marine Explorer is the subject of two documentary films; the first was an episode of the \"Sea Hunters\" that aired on National Geographic International Television in 2004, and the second, by Der Spiegel, which aired in Europe and in the US on the Smithsonian channel in 2010.<PIC>", "images": ["w_s759"], "tokens": 1251}]}

Citizenship may also be granted by naturalization. Naturalization requires a residency period, an examination in the Lithuanian language, examination results demonstrating familiarity with the Lithuanian Constitution, a demonstrated means of support, and an oath of loyalty. A right of return clause was included in the 1991 constitution for persons who left Lithuania after its occupation by the Soviet Union in 1940 and their descendants. Lithuanian citizens are also citizens of the European Union and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. In 1989, the legislature passed a nationality act granting automatic citizenship to those persons who could establish their own birth, or that of a parent or grandparent, within Lithuanian borders. Permanent residents not covered by these criteria were granted citizenship upon signing a loyalty oath. Language proficiency was not required. A 1991 treaty with Russia extended the definition of residency to those who had immigrated to Lithuania from Russia between 1989 and the ratification of the treaty.Subsequent applicants for citizenship were required to meet a set of naturalization standards, including Lithuanian language testing. The citizenship requirements were the most liberal of those in the newly independent Baltic states. This is usually attributed to a relatively low level of immigration from other areas within the Soviet Union, resulting in a more ethnically homogenous population. In November 2006, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania ruled that the Law on Citizenship (wording of 17 September 2002 with subsequent amendments and supplements) was \"controversial, inconsistent and confusing\". At issue was the possession of dual citizenship; the provision extended the right of citizenship, and hence the right to vote, to members of the post-Soviet Lithuanian diaspora, which was concentrated in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Argentina, and their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. The most notable member of this diaspora was Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus, who had become a United States citizen; he formally renounced US citizenship before taking the oath of office. The petitioners held that basing citizenship on ethnic origin or nationality of the person violated the equality of persons and was discriminatory. The use and meaning of the term \"repatriated\" was especially controversial. The Lithuanian Seimas (parliament) passed a temporary law, expiring in 2010, that granted dual citizenship in exceptional cases, most notably to those who were Lithuanian citizens prior to 1940 and who fled during the Soviet occupations, as well as to their children and grandchildren. The Constitution states that Lithuanian citizenship is acquired by birth except in certain cases established by law and that no person may be a citizen of Lithuania and another country or state at the same time, except in special cases. This provision of the Constitution can only be changed by a referendum.Currently, the law on citizenship allows dual citizenship only in exceptional cases for those whose ancestors left Lithuania before its independence from the Soviet Union 1990, but still had Lithuanian citizenship in 1940. There are some things to consider before someone could be able to pass the Lithuanian citizenship eligibility, and by having these, gives the person the right to claim Lithuanian citizenship. Persons who were citizens of independent Lithuania (between 1918 up to 1940) as well as their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren can restore Lithuanian citizenship. Persons of Lithuanian descent can restore dual Lithuanian citizenship if their ancestor still had Lithuanian citizenship in 1940. Dual citizenship can also be extended to descendants of Lithuanian citizens who were exiled to Siberia and stayed in Soviet Union countries. During November 2010 the Seimas passed a law liberalizing dual citizenship requirements. President Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 vetoed it, stating that: \"According to the Constitution, dual citizenship is a rare exception, not a common case.\" On 23 June 2016, the Seimas passed a law further liberalizing dual citizenship requirements. It went into effect on 6 July 2016, amending the Law on Citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania (Law XI-1196 Dec 2, 2010). Article 7 of the Law on Citizenship as amended on 23 June 2016 lists the following criteria for dual citizenship: They have acquired citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania and citizenship of another state at birth. They are a person who left Lithuania before 11 March 1990. This is defined as: at least one of their ancestors (parents, grandparents or great grandparents) was a citizen of the Republic of Lithuania (between 1918 1940); the ancestor left Lithuania (the law changed the former 'fled' requirement) some time before Lithuania restored its independence on 11 March 1990; the ancestor did not depart to the former Soviet Union after 15 June 1940.They are a person who was exiled from the occupied Republic of Lithuania before 11 March 1990. They are a person, or their descendants, who until 15 June 1940 had Lithuanian citizenship and was forcibly deported from Lithuania before 11 March 1990, because of political, social, or ethnic persecution by Soviet and Nazi occupation regimes. They have by virtue of marriage to a citizen of another state ipso facto acquired citizenship of another state. They are adopted by citizen of the Republic of Lithuania before reaching 18 years of age. They have acquired citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania by way of exception while being a citizen of another state. They are a person who has retained citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania or who has citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania restored for his outstanding merits to the State of Lithuania. They have acquired citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania while having refugee status in the Republic of Lithuania. Some countries (such as Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico) do not allow renouncing their citizenship, so applicants might de facto keep dual citizenship even if they are eligible only for single Lithuanian citizenship. In certain cases, only restoration of Lithuanian citizenship as single Lithuanian citizenship is allowed. For example, persons that voluntarily left to former USSR countries prior to 1990 (i.e. were not deported) and have Lithuanian ancestors can restore Lithuanian citizenship but have to renounce their current citizenship. This does not apply to the people that fled or emigrated from Soviet Union before 1990, these persons can restore dual citizenship, since it is considered that they fled occupation. In 2018, at the request of Lithuanian parliament, the constitutional court clarified that being a citizen of both Lithuania and another state at the same time is not acceptable. Those who left Lithuania after it regained independence in 1990 cannot hold dual citizenship therefore it could be changed only by referendum. The referendum to change the Constitution in order to allow Lithuanian citizens also to be citizens of other countries was held on 12 May 2019.Even though most of the voters were in favor of changing the Constitution - the referendum on Lithuanian dual citizenship failed because the turnout was too low. Because Lithuania forms part of the European Union, Lithuanian citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Lithuanian embassy, Lithuanian citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country. Lithuanian citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty. Visa requirements for Lithuanian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Lithuania. In 2015, Lithuanian citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 159 countries and territories, ranking the Lithuanian passport 10th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index. In 2017, the Lithuanian nationality is ranked twenty-second in the Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition to travel freedom, on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.<PIC>", "images": ["w_s762"], "tokens": 1897}]}

Upon its release for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2013, the game generated controversies related to its violence and depiction of women. A mission that requires players to use torture equipment in a hostage interrogation polarised reviewers, who noted its political commentary but felt that the torture sequence was in poor taste; the mission also received criticism from politicians and anti-torture charity groups. The game became subject to widespread online debate over its portrayal of women, particularly in the wake of backlash against GameSpot journalist Carolyn Petit after she claimed the game was misogynistic in her review. After her webpage received over 20,000 largely negative comments, many journalists defended her right to an opinion and lamented the gaming community's hostility towards criticism. Television personality Karen Gravano and actress Lindsay Lohan both filed lawsuits against Rockstar in allegation that characters in the game were based on their likenesses. Target Australia pulled the game from sale after a Change.org petition claimed that the game \"encourages players to commit sexual violence and kill women\", despite the petition being criticised as misleading and portrayals of sexual violence in games already being illegal in Australia.The mission \"By the Book\" generated controversy from reviewers and commentators for its depiction of torture. In the mission, protagonist Trevor Philips interrogates Ferdinand \"Mr. K\" Kerimov to extract information about an Azerbaijani individual believed to have links with terrorists and poses a threat to the FIB (the Federal Investigation Bureau, the game's version of the FBI). Trevor uses torture methods such as electrocution, removing teeth using pliers, hitting Mr. K with a monkey wrench, and waterboarding on the restrained man. Once Mr. K provides the FIB with the information, Trevor is asked to kill him, but instead drives him to the airport, providing him an opportunity to escape. On the drive the airport, Trevor monologues about the ineffectiveness of torture, pointing out Mr. K's readiness to supply the FIB with the information without being tortured, and expressing that torture is used as a power play \"to assert ourselves\". Reviewers echoed that while the mission served as political commentary on the use of torture by the United States government, its use in the game was in poor taste. IGN's Keza MacDonald felt the sequence \"pushed the boundaries of taste\", and Polygon's Chris Plante said, \"the script plays it for laughs. I felt nauseated.\" Carolyn Petit of GameSpot felt that placing the torture scene in context with the monologue created a hypocrisy in the mission's function as a commentary device. In an editorial, Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer discussed whether the political commentary was overshadowed by the violent content, and compared the mission to the controversy surrounding Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2's \"No Russian\" mission. He said that the close-up camera and quick time events accentuated the sequence's impact beyond the violence depicted in previous Grand Theft Auto games.Summarising its function as \"flawed\", he considered the sequence lacking enough context to justify its violence. Keith Best of Freedom from Torture said that developer Rockstar North \"crossed a line\" by forcing players into the role of torturer. British Labour Party MP Keith Vaz said he was \"astonished\" by the mission's violence, and Alison Sherratt of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers said that parents should be aware of children being exposed to the game because of its realistic graphics and violence. Independent journalist Tom Chick defended the torture sequence, and wrote that unlike the \"No Russian\" mission or the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty, the underlying political commentary on torture in \"By the Book\" necessitated the violent content. When asked about performing the torture sequence, Trevor's actor Steven Ogg said he treated it like \"just another day at the office\", and was focused more on not making mistakes during filming than the scene's ethics. The torture sequence is censored in Japanese versions of the game.<PIC> Some reviewers claim that the game's portrayal of women is misogynistic. Chris Plante of Polygon felt that the supporting female characters were constructed on stereotypes, and wrote that the game's \"treatment of women is a relic from the current generation\". Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times considered the satirical portrayals of women uncreative, and added that violent and sexist themes hurt the game experience. Edge noted that while \"every female in the game exists solely to be sneered, leered or laughed at\", it treated its all-male lead characters in a similar vein through their stereotyped tendencies towards violence. Dave Cook of VG247 reinforced the sentiment that the female characters were constructed on stereotypes in an editorial: \"They're either there to be rescued, shouted at, fucked, to be seen fucking, put up with, killed, heard prattling away like dullards on their mobile phones or shopping\".inst Rockstar Games in allegation that a character in the game is based on her likeness and story and was depicted without her consent. Rockstar filed to dismiss Gravano's lawsuit in April, and stated that the allegations are foreclosed by the First Amendment. In July, actress Lindsay Lohan also filed a lawsuit, claiming elements in the game, including the Lacey Jonas character, were influenced by her image, voice and clothing line without permission. Rockstar responded in court papers that sought a dismissal of the case, saying that the case was frivolous and filed for publicity purposes.

{"id": 30419, "dataset": "wiki", "images": ["w_s799"], "chunks": [{"chunk_id": 1, "text": "This article outlines the legislative chronology concerning the use of official languages in Belgium. A factor in the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s was the rising dominance of the Dutch language in the southern provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. A conflict arose between the citizenry of the Flemish provinces who wished to engage with the authorities in Dutch, and the largely francophone aristocracy of the southern provinces which became modern-day Belgium. While the Belgian Constitution guaranteed \"freedom of language\", in practice the authorities, including government institutions such as the courts, were dominated by the French-speaking upper classes, and operated in French. This bias disadvantaged the largely Flemish North and, to a lesser degree, the Walloons of the South and the mainly German- or Luxembourgish-speaking environs of Arlon. As universal education developed in Belgium, the French language was initially the sole medium of instruction, alienating the northern half of the country. There was a similar sense of alienation in other areas such as justice, as the trial and conviction of two Flemish labourers, Jan Coucke and Pieter Goethals, in 1860 demonstrated.The pair were sentenced to death for the murder of a widow without having understood one single word of their trial, and were then found to be innocent after they were executed. The Flemish Movement started to advocate language legislation that would recognise Dutch as an official language. The first law on the use of languages was voted on in 1873, perhaps influenced by growing public dissent occasioned by cases such as the 1872 case of Jozef Schoep. He refused to pay a fine of 50 francs for not wanting to declare the birth of his son to the municipal administration of Molenbeek in French, only to be convicted after an appeal in Cassation. This and other cases provoked the discussions about the use of languages, and the first law on the use of languages, supported by Edward Coremans, regulated the use of languages in the courts in Flanders. Dutch became the major language in Flanders, but oral testimony and penal action were still permitted in French. The second law on the use of languages in 1878 regulated the use of language in the administrations of Flanders and Brussels. Announcements to the public by government officials had to be made either in Dutch or in both languages. Correspondence with municipalities or persons would be in Dutch unless a person expressed a wish to be engaged in French, but in reality the law was hardly applied in daily life: Flemish citizens were still obliged to communicate with the administration in French, because most civil servants were monoglots who either spoke only French or refused to use the Dutch language. Until 1883, education in secondary schools had been entirely in French. The third law on the use of languages was voted on in order to introduce bilingual education. In 1898, the Law on Equality was introduced. Dutch and French were now to be regarded as co-equal official languages but native French speakers in parliament, unwilling to learn or use Dutch, were either unable or unwilling to read the Dutch texts they were supposed to vote on.The reverse was not the case: Dutch speakers were obliged to learn French.) Nevertheless, under pressure from the general population, the law was passed, largely due to the extension of suffrage to every male citizen aged 25 and above which increased the number of Flemish voters, and the introduction of plural voting in 1893 which allowed some eligible voters to cast more than one vote. Disagreement over the country's language policy continued. Some segments of French-speaking Wallonia were concerned that current practices could result in Belgium becoming a bilingual country, with French and Dutch being recognised as official languages everywhere. This led to a proposal to split the administration in Belgium to preserve the French-speaking nature of Wallonia and to avoid the possibility that French-speaking civil servants there might have to pass a Dutch language examination. This implied a choice: should Belgium become a bilingual country or a country with two language regions? This was expressed in two alternatives: Personality principle: All citizens have the freedom to address the authorities in whichever Belgian language they choose, regardless of their region of residence. Territoriality principle: The official language in a particular region follows restricted language boundaries, which means that all official dealings with the authorities will take place in the language of the region. In 1921, the principle of territoriality was chosen; it was confirmed by further legislation, with landmark laws passed in 1932 and 1962. The language areas were outlined according to the principle of the language of the majority of the population, and a provision in the 1932 law determined that a language census should be conducted every ten years: a municipality could change its linguistic status only according to the findings of the census. This more flexible approach opened the possibility of minorities representing a minimum 30% of the local population being able to obtain services in their native, or chosen, language. A 1962 law determined which municipality belonged to what language area.Each Belgian municipality is restricted to one language area, of which there are four: Dutch, French, German, and the bilingual area Brussels-Capital that includes the Belgian capital city and eighteen surrounding municipalities. From then on, modifications of the linguistic regime would be possible only after changing the law, which required a majority of each language community. In that same year, the municipality of Voeren (Fourons) went to the Dutch-speaking province of Limburg, and Comines (Komen) and Mouscron (Moeskroen) to the French-speaking province of Hainaut. These and several other municipalities obtained facilities for the minority language group. In a municipality with a minority speaking another official language, facilities were provided for registered residents speaking that language. For example, education in an alternative official language was made available as long as sixteen or more parents requested its provision. (However a resident of a municipality has no such rights in any neighbouring municipality.) To benefit from these facilities, they must be asked for by the person concerned. This raised the issue of whether the facilities had to be requested on each and every occasion or whether a single request conferred a blanket benefit. In 1997 the Peeters directive required that inhabitants of such municipalities must request such facilities in their chosen language on each and every occasion they want to enjoy that right. This led to a crisis in Voeren surrounding the mayor, Jos\u00e9 Happart. Protests raised by French-speakers before the European Court of Human Rights ECtHR were mostly unsuccessful (e.g. Belgian Linguistics Case), a number of institutions such as the Catholic University of Leuven obtained authorisation to become bilingual. In 1970, on the completion of the first state reform, four language areas were established by Article 4 of the Constitution. Since then the language affiliation of municipalities can be changed only by special law.At the same time language communities were established, with the Flemish and French Communities being responsible for the regulation of the use of languages in their language area in the areas of administration, education, and for interactions between employers and their workforce. Currently the language used by the Belgian authorities, administration, education, businesses, and the army is determined by the courts. The constitutional right of freedom of language remains intact and absolute only in the home, leading to ongoing tensions in Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde. The National Railway Company of Belgium's policy is to provide information on the train in the language of the region. For example, on a train travelling from Antwerp to Charleroi, announcements are made first in Dutch (in the Flemish Region), then in French and Dutch (in the Brussels-Capital Region), again in Dutch and finally in French in Wallonia. Station announcements at Eupen and Hergenrath, the two stations in the German-speaking community, are made in German and French (in that order). This requires rail travellers to be conversant with the name of their destination in both languages (though on-board ticket inspectors are bound to respond in either language). In and around international stations, such as Brussels Airport, Dutch and French announcements are supplemented by announcements in German and English.<PIC> As mentioned above, road signs are required to give destinations only in the local language, requiring travellers to recognise their ultimate and intermediate destinations in multiple languages. For example, on the Belgian portion of the E40 motorway, westbound travellers to Li\u00e8ge are directed to L\u00fcttich and eastbound travellers are directed to Luik, but signs near the city itself refer only to Li\u00e8ge.", "images": ["w_s799"], "tokens": 2012}]}

The nets are kept vertical in the water by floats attached to a rope along the top of the net and weights attached to another rope along the bottom of the net. Drift nets generally rely on the entanglement properties of loosely affixed netting. Folds of loose netting, much like a window drapery, snag on a fish's tail and fins and wrap the fish up in loose netting as it struggles to escape. However the nets can also function as gill nets if fish are captured when their gills get stuck in the net. The size of the mesh varies depending on the fish being targeted. These nets usually target schools of pelagic fish. Traditionally drift nets were made of organic materials, such as hemp, which were biodegradable. Prior to 1950, nets tended to have a larger mesh size. The larger mesh only caught the larger fish, allowing the smaller, younger ones to slip through. When drift net fishing grew in scale during the 1950s, the industry changed to synthetic materials with smaller mesh size.Synthetic nets last longer, are odourless and may be nearly invisible in the water, and do not biodegrade. Most countries regulate drift net fisheries within their territories. Such fisheries are also often regulated by international agreements. Drift net fishing became a commercial fishing practice because it is cost effective. Nets can be placed by low-powered vessels making it fuel efficient. Drift nets are also effective at bringing in large amounts of fish in one catch. Prior to the 1960s net size was not limited, and commercially produced nets were commonly as long as 50 kilometres (31 mi). In 1987 the U.S. enacted the Driftnet Impact, Monitoring, Assessment and Control Act limiting the length of nets used in American waters to 1.5 nautical miles (\u22481.7 miles, \u22482.778 km). In 1989 the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) placed a moratorium on the practice of drift net fishing. In 1992 the UN banned the use of drift nets longer than 2.5 km long in international waters.<PIC> Any fish that crosses the path of a drift net in the ocean may be tangled or caught in the net. This leads to fish species becoming endangered or even extinct. Non-target individuals caught in the net are called by-catch. In 1994 United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) estimated global by-catch rates to be as high as 27 million tons of fish discarded by fisheries each year. Many individuals of non-target species perish as by-catch in the cast of each drift net. As a result, many such species are now endangered. Species caught as by-catch include sharks, dolphins, whales, turtles, sea birds, and other marine mammals. Since nets are placed and may not be retrieved for days, air-breathing mammals that become tangled in the nets drown if they are unable to free themselves. In certain areas, exemption from punitive measure due to the unintentional by-catch of marine mammals, as outlined by the Marine Mammal Protection Act, is extended to commercial drift fishermen.Drift nets also are used in ecological studies in studying the downstream drift of invertebrates and Ichthyoplankton. The nets are strung across a stream and allowed to sit overnight, collecting samples. These nets are crucial in the understanding of how watersheds function. Quantitative estimates derived from drift nets used in this way in rivers need careful consideration given the clogging of the nets and decay in performance that can occur as a result.", "images": ["w_s886"], "tokens": 885}]}

Despite some uses of the term to refer to the precursors of oogonia, it was generally restricted to male germ cells. Germ cells operate as vehicles of inheritance by transferring genetic and epigenetic information from one generation to the next. Male fertility is centered around continual spermatogonia which is dependent upon a high stem cell population. Thus, the function and quality of a differentiated sperm cell is dependent upon the capacity of its originating spermatogonial stem cell (SSC). Gonocytes represent the germ cells undergoing the successive, short-term and migratory stages of development. This occurs between the time they inhabit the forming gonads on the genital ridge to the time they migrate to the basement membrane of the seminiferous cords. Gonocyte development consists of several phases of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. The abnormal development of gonocytes leads to fertility-related diseases.They are also identified as prespermatogonia, prospermatogonia and primitive germ cells, although gonocyte is most common. Gonocytes are described as large and spherical, with a prominent nucleus and two nucleoli. The term, gonocyte, was created in 1957 by Canadian scientists Yves Clermont and Bernard Perey. They considered it essential to study the origin of spermatogonia and carried out a study on rats to investigate this. In 1987, Clermont referred to gonocytes as the cells that differentiate into type A spermatogonia, which differentiate into type B spermatogonia and spermatocytes. Very few studies used gonocytes to also refer to the female germ cells in the ovarium primordium. The specification of gonocytes to be confined to male germ cells occurred after foundational differences between the mechanisms of male and female fetal germ cells were uncovered. Some scientists prefer the terms \u201cprospermatogonia\u201d and \u201cprespermatogonia\u201d for their functional clarity. Later studies found that the process from primordial germ cell to spermatogonial development is gradual, without clear gene expression markers to distinguish the precursor cells. A 2006 study found that some gonocytes differentiate straight into committed spermatogonia (type B) rather than spermatogonial stem cells (type A). Gonocytes are long-lived precursor germ cells responsible for the production of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Gonocytes relate to both fetal and neonatal germ cells from the point at which they enter the testis primordial until they reach the base membrane at the seminiferous cords and differentiate. At the time of gastrulation, certain cells are set aside for later gamete development. These cells are called post migratory germ cells (PGCs). The gonocyte population develops from the post migratory germ cells (PGCs) around embryonic day (ED) 15. At this point of development, PGCs become dormant and remain inactiveted until birth. Shortly after birth, the cell cycle continues and the production of postnatal spermatogonia commences.Gonocytes migrate to the basement membrane to proliferate. Gonocytes that do not migrate undergo apoptosis and are cleared from the seminiferous epithelium. Spermatogonia are formed in infancy and differentiate throughout adult life. There are currently two proposed models for the formation of the spermatogonial lineage during neonatal development. Both models theorize that the gonocyte population develops from a subset of post migratory germ cells (PGCs) but, differ in the proposed subsets of derived gonocytes. One of the models proposes that the PGCs give rise to a single subset of pluripotent gonocytes that either become SSCs from which progenitors then arise or differentiate into type A spermatogonia directly. The other model proposes that the PGCs give rise tomultiple predetermined subsets of gonocytes that produce the foundational SSC pool, initial progenitor spermatogonial population, and initial differentiating type A spermatogonia. The development of germ cells can be divided into two phases. The first phases involves the fetal and neonatal phases of germ cell development that lead to the formation of the SSCs. The second phase is spermatogenesis, which is a cycle of regulated mitosis, meiosis and differentiation (via spermiogenesis) leading to the production of mature spermatozoa, also known as sperm cells. Gonocytes are functionally present during the first phase of germ cell maturation and development. This period consists of the primordial germ cells (PGC), the initial cells that commence germ cell development in the embryo, and the gonocytes, which after being differentiated from PGCs, undergo regulated proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis to produce the SSCs. Gonocytes therefore correspond to the developmental stages between the PGCs and SSCs. Gonocytes are formed from the differentiation of PGCs.Embryonic cells initiate germ cell development in the proximal epiblast located near the extra-embryonic ectoderm by the release of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and BMP8b. These proteins specify embryonic cells into PGCs expressing the genes PRDM1 and PRDM14 at embryonic day (E) 6.25. The PGCs which are positively stained by alkaline phosphatase and expressing Stella at E7.25 are also specified. In between E7.5 and E12.5, these PGCs migrate towards the genital ridge, where they form the testicular cords, via the cytokine interactions of the CXCR4 and c-Kit membrane receptors and their ligands SDF1 and SCF respectively. During this migratory period, PGCs undergo epigenetic reprogramming through genome-wide DNA demethylation. Once resident in the genital ridge, these germ cells and surrounding supporting cells undergo sex determination driven by the expression of the SRY gene. It is only afterthese developmental steps that the germ cells present in the developed testicular cords are identified as gonocytes. In order to provide the long-term production of sperm, gonocytes undergo proliferation to produce a populate pool of SSCs. Once enclosed by Sertoli cells to form the testicular cords, gonocytes undergo a succession of differing fetal and neonatal periods of mitosis, with a phase of quiescence in between. The mitotic activity that occurs in the neonatal period is necessary for the migration of gonocytes to the basement membrane of the seminiferous cords in order to differentiate into the SSCs. As many populations of gonocytes are in different stages of development, mitotic and quiescent gonocytes coexist in neonatal developing testes. Proliferation in fetal and neonatal gonocytes is differently regulated. Retinoic acid (RA), the bioactive metabolite of retinal, is a morphogen shown to modulate fetal gonocyte proliferation. Investigation of fetal gonocyte activity in organ cultures recorded RA to slightly stimulate proliferation.Moreover, RA inhibited differentiation by stopping the fetal gonocytes from entering mitotic arrest while simultaneously triggering apoptosis. RA, by decreasing the overall fetal gonocyte population via apoptosis, is speculated to allow the elimination of mutated and dysfunctional germ cells. The activation of protein kinase C by phorbol ester PMA also decreased fetal gonocyte mitotic activity. There are a number of factors that influence neonatal gonocyte proliferation, including 17\u03b2\u2010estradiol (E2), Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, and RA. The production of PDGF-BB and E2 by surrounding Sertoli cells activate their respective receptors on neonatal gonocytes, triggering proliferation via an interactive, crosstalk mechanism. The regulation of LIF is speculated to allow gonocytes to become sensitive to Sertoli cell factors that trigger proliferation, such as PDGF-BB and E2. Compared to fetal gonocytes, RA exerts a similar functional role in neonatal gonocytes; It simultaneously stimulates proliferation and apoptosis for regulation of gonocyte and future SSCs population. The migration of gonocytes to the basement membrane of the seminiferous cords is necessary for their differentiation into SSCs. This process is regulated by different factors. Various studies provide comprehensive comparison of the expression of c-Kit on the membrane of cells and migratory-related behavior, for example PGCs. Although c-Kit expression is evident in a small fraction of neonatal gonocytes, they also express of PDGF receptor beta (PDGFR\u03b2) on their membrane to aid in their migration. Inhibition of PDGF receptors and c-Kit by in vivo treatment of imatinib, an inhibitory drug, interrupted migration, leading to a number of gonocytes centrally located in the seminiferous cords. The ADAM-Integrin-Tetraspanin complexes, which is a family of proteins, also mediate gonocyte migration.These complexes consist of various proteins that bind to integrins found on the basement membrane of the seminiferous cords and at locations where spermatogonia normally reside, allowing the gonocyte to migrate and bind to the basement membrane. The differentiation of gonocytes to SSC only occur once the cells have established close contact with the basement membrane in the seminiferous cords. RA is the best characterised activator of gonocyte differentiation. De novo synthesis of RA involves retinol, the precursor to RA, being transported to the membrane receptor STRA6 by the retinol-binding protein released by Sertoli cells. Binding of retinol to STRA6 endocytoses retinol into the cell, whereby it undergoes oxidation reactions to form RA. RA is also directly transported from the surrounding Sertoli cells or the vasculature. RA internalization triggers a variety of pathways that modulate the differentiation, such as PDGF receptor pathways and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) signaling pathway. Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH), a glycoprotein gonadal hormone produced by Sertoli cells in early development, is the only hormone to significantly increase the number of successfully differentiated gonocytes. The timing of differentiation is regulated by NOTCH signaling. The functional components of the NOTCH signaling pathway are expressed and released by both developing and adult Sertoli cells. Activation of the signaling pathway is crucial for gonocyte development as it triggers gonocytes to depart from quiescence and enter into differentiation. Over activation of the pathway allows effective inhibition of quiescence and gonocyte differentiation.<PIC> Gonocytes are large cells with a spherical euchromatic nucleus, two nucleoli and a surrounding, ring-like cytosol. Throughout the majority of their developmental period, gonocytes are structurally supported by the cytoplasmic extensions of surrounding Sertoli cells and are suspended by Sertoli cell nuclei from the basement membrane. Gonocytes are attached to Sertoli cells by gap junctions, desmosome junctions and a number of different cell adhesion molecules such as connexin 43, PB-cadherin and NCAM for regulation of cell-to-cell communication.s until it becomes an overt germ cell cancer after puberty. Cryptorchidism, also known as undescended testis, is a common birth defect affecting male genital formation. Individuals diagnosed with cryptorchidism are often at risk of testicular cancer and infertility due to dysfunction in the development of the neonatal germ cells, in particular, the disruption of the differentiation of gonocytes into adult dark-spermatogonia. It is proposed that this dysfunction is a product of heat stress caused by the undescended testes remaining in the abdomen and unable to regulate its temperature which is often accomplished by the scrotum.", "images": ["w_s935"], "tokens": 2976}]}

Although the SNX dimer is required for the recruitment of retromer to the endosomal membrane, the cargo binding function of this complex is contributed by the core trimer through the binding of Vps35 subunit to various cargo molecules including M6PR wntless and sortilin. Early study on sorting of acid hydrolases such as carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) in S. cerevisiae mutants has led to the identification of retromer in mediating the retrograde trafficking of the pro-CPY receptor (Vps10) from the endosomes to the TGN. The retromer complex is highly conserved: homologs have been found in C. elegans, mouse and human.The increased level of Retromer SNX-BARs causes a conformational switch to a curvature-inducing mode which initiates membrane tubule formation. Once the cargo carriers are matured, the carrier scission is then catalyzed by dynamin-II or EHD1, together with the mechanical forces generated by actin polymerization and motor activity. The cargo carrier is transported to the TGN by motor proteins such as dynein. Tethering of the cargo carrier to the recipient compartment will lead to the uncoating of the carrier which is driven by ATP-hydrolysis and Rab7-GTP hydrolysis. Once released from the carrier, the Vps35-Vps29-Vps26 complex and the SNX-BAR dimers get recycled back onto the endosomal membranes.", "images": ["w_s944"], "tokens": 474}]}

Red Jacket won 11 of 13 races in her first season, including the Charles Freeman Cup and the Lake Ontario International. In the 1967 Southern Ocean Racing Conference (SORC) race from St. Petersburg to Venice in Florida, Red Jacket finished first. It was the first Canadian boat to win against a fleet of about 85 others, many being the best U.S. racers. Erich Bruckmann was born in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany in 1930. The only child of Klara and Ludwig, he suffered from tuberculosis, an ailment that relapsed late in his life. Bruckmann at times spoke about his difficult youth in war-torn Germany. After the Second World War ended and his health returned, he became an active youth, playing soccer and cycling.He met his future wife, Lisa (briefly) on a bicycle tour around Germany and, despite the brevity of the meeting, sent her a postcard from every subsequent destination. Bruckmann left Germany as a young man in 1956 to start a new life in Canada. Bruckmann was trained as a cabinetmaker and master carpenter in his native Germany. Bruckmann arrived in Oakville, Ontario from Germany in 1956, speaking no English and with little other than his carpentry tools, hoping to bring his wife and first-born son to Canada as soon as possible. His first years in Ontario after arriving were difficult. He showed up for his first job in the boat-building trade with no references and little English but with a toolbox of his own construction \u2013 the meticulously organized and crafted box served as his best reference.

Metro Marine had evolved into a first-class yacht yard under the direction of John \u201cJohnnie\u201d Walker and, after a short time, Erik Bruckmann was made Shop Superintendent. While at Metro Marine Bruckman oversaw the construction of several Cuthbertson & Cassian designs, including the 38-foot La Mouette, a wooden design built for Gord Fisher of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, which led to a semi-production series. In 1962 Bruckmann left Metro Marine in Bronte to found his own cabinetmaking business, ostensibly to build kitchen cabinets and counters, but he had undertaken several yacht jobs, including completion of a Canadian Northern CN35 from a Cuthbertson & Cassian design. His skills had become known and appreciated. Erich Bruckmann began Bruckmann Manufacturing on Maple Avenue in Burlington, Ontario. He later set up shop on Wallace Road in the Speers Road and Third Line area of Oakville, Ontario, still as Bruckmann Mfg. Canadian yachtsman Perry Connolly asked George Cuthbertson of Cuthbertson & Cassian to design a custom 40 ft (12 m) racing sloop for him.The design directive called for flat-out speed. Connolly said he wanted \"the meanest, hungriest 40-footer afloat\". As a result of a connection through his earlier relationship with Metro Marine, Bruckmann was asked to build this new boat, named Red Jacket, from the design by Cuthbertson. Starting in 1963 and through 1964 Red Jacket, was built by Erich Bruckmann at Bruckmann Manufacturing in fiberglass with a balsa core, the resulting structure was strong, stiff and significantly lighter than the wood or solid fiberglass yachts then sailing. Red Jacket is considered to be the first sailboat engineered with a cored hull (other earlier boats had balsa-cored decks and powerboat builders were then using it in transoms and superstructures). No doubt the weight savings and panel stiffness of her cored hull contributed significantly to her racing success. She was launched in May 1966 and took 11 of 13 starts that summer. That winter, Red Jacket headed south and won the famed SORC (Southern Ocean Racing Conference), also called \"the circuit,\" which was a series of six races with the major two being from St. Petersburg to Fort Lauderdale and from Miami to Nassau, competing against over 85 of the best racers of the day. Red Jacket was the first Canadian boat to win the SORC. She is still actively raced by her owners, members the Royal Canadian Yacht Club. That victory was quickly followed by a successful defence of the Canada\u2019s Cup with Manitou in 1969. This racing success resulted in the formation of C&C Yachts in the same year with the amalgamation of the design firm and the three builders producing Cuthbertson & Cassian designs. In September 1969 the design firm of Cuthbertson & Cassian Ltd. joined with Belleville Marine Yard, Hinterhoeller Ltd. and Bruckmann Manufacturing to form C&C Yachts. In that first year C&C achieved sales of $3.9 million.As a result of this merger, Bruckmann\u2019s Oakville plant became part of C&C Yachts, operating as the C&C Custom Yachts Division with Erich Bruckmann assuming responsibility for custom manufacturing and mold development. During that time, C&C Custom Yachts built some 200 custom and semi-custom boats, including many renowned racing and cruising yachts. Under Bruckmann the Custom Shop built such Cuthbertson & Cassian designs as the Redline 41, C&C 43-1, C&C 50, and the successful C&C 61. The Redline 41 Condor would follow Red Jacket's lead and win SORC overall in 1971. In the year of the merger Erich Bruckmann's custom shop was doing well financially. In 1966-67, meticulous craftsmanship had seen only three yachts completed; an ongoing expansion increased its output of semi-custom yachts alone to 62 annually. The high water mark of the Custom Division career was the 1971 SORC where Cuthbertson & Cassian designed boats not only won overall, but also won three of the five divisions. A truly remarkable feat, which has never been achieved by another designer. The ground breaking yacht Evergreen, Canada's Cup winner and Fastnet survivor, was perhaps Bruckmann's most recognized achievement. The Canada's Cup winner in 1978 was a C&C design, the Two Ton class Evergreen, owned by Don Green with Hans Fogh at the helm. The design was a radical, dinghy-like, 41-foot boat, designed with the aim of winning the trophy as the C&C design team had exploited loopholes in the regatta rules. As one example, the galley was required to have sink but, in order to save weight, it had no drain, which the rule makers had not thought to specify. The deck hatches opened inward, which could be a safety hazard if they gave way during a capsize or broach, and the Evergreen crew faced protests over this defect in both the SORC and in the Canada's Cup. Upon reflection over the 1979 Fastnet race in which he participated but prudently DNF'ed, Skipper Green later said that Evergreen \"never should have gone to England\" for the Admiral's Cup, which is the destination of most Canada's Cup winners.Canadian Yachting magazine stated fifteen years later that \"few yachts have created more controversy than\" Evergreen, and that \"its extreme design and controversial features ruffled feathers around the world.\" After the competition that year, the rule books were rewritten to preclude safety problems like those raised by the design of Evergreen, and as a result, C&C never received another commission for a Canada's Cup yacht. The C&C Custom 67 is a Canadian sailboat, that was designed by Robert W. Ball of C&C Yachts and was launched and named Archangel in September 1980. The boat was built by Bruckmann and his crew at the C&C Yachts Custom Division in Oakville. She remains the largest pleasureboat commission ever received by C&C, and was an enormous project: six months in design and 14 months in construction. Only one example was completed.<PIC> After his retireErich Bruckmann was awarded the Canadian Yachting Magazine, Ontario Sailing, 2011 Legends of Ontario Sailing Award as one of the \u201cBuilders of C&C Yachts\u201d", "images": ["w_s989"], "tokens": 2024}]}

In a series of experiments extending over many years (1869 to 1891), he showed that a partial section of the spinal cord, or a section of the sciatic nerve, was followed after a few weeks by a peculiar morbid state resembling epilepsy. The offspring of the animals operated on were frequently decrepit, and a certain number showed a tendency to the so-called epilepsy. Although some scientists considered the experiments as evidence for Lamarckian inheritance, the experiments were not Lamarckian as Lamarck had rejected that this sort of acquired characteristic was inherited as such experiments did not involve the use and disuse of characters in response to the environment. One explanation for the results was that they show a transmitted disease and not evidence for the inheritance of an acquired character.

Some researchers believe it was used in the construction of megalithic structures. The proposal was made by Alexander Thom as a result of his surveys of 600 megalithic sites in England, Scotland, Wales and Brittany. Thom also proposed the megalithic rod of 2.5 megalithic yards, or on average across sites 6.77625 feet. As subunits of these, he further proposed the megalithic inch of 2.073 centimetres (0.816 in), one hundred of which are included in a megalithic rod, and forty of which composed a megalithic yard. Thom applied the statistical lumped variance test of J.R. Broadbent on this quantum and found the results significant, while others have challenged his statistical analysis and suggested that Thom's evidence can be explained in other ways, for instance that the supposed megalithic yard is in fact the average length of a pace. Thom suggested that \"There must have been a headquarters from which standard rods were sent out but whether this was in these islands or on the Continent the present investigation cannot determine.\" Margaret Ponting has suggested that artefacts such as a marked bone found during excavations at Dail M\u00f2r near Callanish, the Patrickholme bone bead from Lanarkshire and Dalgety bone bead from Fife in Scotland have shown some evidence of being measuring rods based on the megalithic yard in Britain. An oak rod from the Iron Age fortified settlement at Borre Fen measured 53.15 inches (135.0 cm) with marks dividing it up into eight parts of 6.64 inches (16.9 cm). Euan Mackie referred to five-eighths of this rod 33.2 inches (84 cm) as \"very close to a megalithic yard\". A hazel measuring rod recovered from a Bronze Age burial mound in Borum Esh\u00f8j, East Jutland by P. V. Glob in 1875 measured 30.9 inches (78 cm). Keith Critchlow suggested this may have shrunk 0.63 inches (1.6 cm) from its original length of one megalithic yard over a period of 3000 years. Thom made a comparison of his megalithic yard with the Spanish vara, the pre-metric measurement of Iberia, whose length was 2.7425 feet (0.8359 m). Archaeologist Euan Mackie noticed similarities between the megalithic yard and a unit of measurement extrapolated from a long, marked shell from Mohenjo Daro and ancient measuring rods used in mining in the Austrian Tyrol. He suggested similarities with other measurements such as the ancient Indian gaz and the Sumerian \u0161u-du3-a. Along with John Michell, Mackie also noted that it is the diagonal of a rectangle measuring 2 by 1 Egyptian remens. Jay Kappraff has noted similarity between the megalithic yard and the ancient Indus short yard of 33 inches (0.84 m). Anne Macaulay reported that the megalithic rod is equal in length to the Greek fathom of (2.072 metres (6.80 ft)) from studies by Eric Fernie of the Metrological Relief in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Thom's proposals were initially ignored or regarded as unbelievable by mainstream archaeologists. Clive Ruggles, citing astronomer Douglas C.Heggie, has said that both classical and Bayesian statistical reassessments of Thom's data \"reached the conclusion that the evidence in favour of the megalithic yard was at best marginal, and that even if it does exist the uncertainty in our knowledge of its value is of the order of centimetres, far greater than the 1mm precision claimed by Thom. In other words, the evidence presented by Thom could be adequately explained by, say, monuments being set out by pacing, with the 'unit' reflecting an average length of pace.\" David George Kendall makes the same argument, and says that pacing would have created a greater difference in measurements between sites, and that a statistical analysis of sites would reveal whether they were measured by pacing or not. In an investigation for the Royal Academy Kendall concluded that there was evidence of a uniform unit in Scottish circles but not in English circles, and that further research was needed. Statistician P. R. Freeman reached similar conclusions and found that two other units fit the data as well as the yard. Douglas Heggie casts doubt on Thom's suggestion as well, stating that his careful analysis uncovered \"little evidence for a highly accurate unit\" and \"little justification for the claim that a highly accurate unit was in use\". In his book Rings of Stone: The Prehistoric Stone Circles of Britain and Ireland. Aubrey Burl calls the megalithic yard \"a chimera, a grotesque statistical misconception.\" Most researchers have concluded that there is marginal evidence for a standardized measuring unit, but that it was not as uniform as Thom believed. Some commentators upon Thom's megalithic yard (John Ivimy and then Euan Mackie) have noted how such a measure could relate to geometrical ideas found historically in two Egyptian metrological units; the remen of about 1.2 feet and royal cubit of about 1.72 feet. The remen and royal cubit were used to define land areas in Egypt: \"On documentary and other evidence Griffith came to the conclusion that the square on the royal cubit was intended to be twice that on the remen; and Petri identified the remen as a length of 20 digits\".A square with side length equal to the diagonal of a square with side length equal to one remen has an area of one square royal cubit, ten thousand (a myriad) of which defined an Egyptian land measure, the setat. John Ivimy noted that \"The ratio MY : Rc is SQRT(5) : SQRT(2) to the nearest millimeter, which makes the MY equal to SQRT(5) remens, or the length of a 2 \u00d7 1 remen rectangle.\" see figure at right. The main weakness in this argument is probably that, in order to derive their yard, the builders of the megalithic monuments would have needed the remen and royal cubit, upon which this geometrical relationship relies. However, since the megalithic constructs of the British Isles and northern France predate the pyramids by millennia, this supposed counter-argument is anachronistic. Recent work by John Michell (Ancient Metrology, The Lost Science of Measuring the Earth), John Near (All Done with Mirrors), Richard and Robin Heath (various works on British megalithic circles and on Carnac), and others, make a compelling case for the connection of the megalithic yard with a systemic relation of geodetics and the lunation cycle.<PIC>", "images": ["w_s1002"], "tokens": 1581}]}

The task force consisted of warships from the United States Navy and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). It was generally assigned as a striking force to defend northeast Australia and the surrounding area from any attacks by Axis forces, particularly from the Empire of Japan. The task force was created on 22 April 1942 from the ANZAC Squadron as part of United States Army General Douglas MacArthur's South West Pacific Area (command). The unit's first commander was Rear Admiral John Gregory Crace (Royal Australian Navy). From 13 June 1942 the task force was commanded by Victor Crutchley, an Australian Rear Admiral of the Royal Navy (UK). The force saw action during the Battle of the Coral Sea, in which it helped turn back a Japanese attempt to invade Port Moresby, New Guinea. At the start of May, the Americans learned of an imminent Japanese invasion of Port Moresby, and HMAS Hobart was sent with HMAS Australia to rendezvous with United States forces in the Coral Sea.At 07:00 on 7 May, Rear Admiral Crace, embarked aboard Australia as commander of Task Force 44, was ordered to take his ships (Australia, Hobart, US cruiser Chicago, and US destroyers Perkins, Walke, and Farragut) to the Jomard Passage, and engage any Japanese ships found en route to Port Moresby, while several US carrier groups engaged a Japanese force headed for the Solomon Islands. The ships reached their patrol area around 14:00, fired on a group of eleven unidentified aircraft at maximum range with no damage dealt at 14:27, and were attacked themselves by twelve Japanese twin-engine torpedo bombers at 15:06; no ships were damaged for the loss of five aircraft. At 15:16, nineteen Japanese heavy bombers dropped their payload on the Allied ships; no ships were hit directly, the only casualties (aboard Chicago) were from shrapnel. A few minutes later, the ships were attacked by another three heavy bombers, flying at a higher altitude to the first group; the bombing was much less accurate. It was later learned that the three aircraft belonged to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Although USN Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary made plans to train aircrews in naval vessel recognition in response, USAAF General George Brett refused to implement them or acknowledge that the friendly fire incident had happened. With no new orders, Crace decided to relocate his ships during the night to a point 220 nautical miles (410 km; 250 mi) from Port Moresby, to better intercept a Japanese invasion force if it came through either the Jomard Passage or the China Strait. Instructions from the American commander of the operation were still not forthcoming, and Crace was forced to rely on intercepted radio messages to track the progress of the main battle. The task force remained in their assigned area until 01:00 on 10 May, when Crace ordered them to withdraw south to Cid Harbour on Whitsunday Island; the lack of reports and intelligence concerning either the Americans or Japanese led him to conclude that both forces had withdrawn, and there was no immediate threat to Port Moresby. The Task Force was temporarily redesignated Task Group 17.3 (of the U.S.aircraft carrier task force Task Force 17) during the battle. The task force later, under Crutchley, assisted with the initial stages of the Guadalcanal Campaign along with escorting Allied convoys around the northeast Australia, New Guinea, and Coral Sea areas. In August 1942, the force participated in the Battle of Savo Island. The next month, the unit served with the U.S. Navy's Task Force 18, centered on the aircraft carrier USS Wasp.<PIC> When the Operation Pamphlet convoy sailed from Fremantle on 20 February 1943 it was escorted by the Australian light cruiser HMAS Adelaide, as well as the Dutch cruiser Jacob van Heemskerck and destroyer Tjerk Hiddes.

Estimates of the number of Palestinian descendants in Chile range from 450,000 to 500,000. The effects of their migration are widely visible. The earliest Palestinian migrants came in the 1850s during the Crimean War, fleeing due to Russia's intent to capture and control the Holy Land. They worked mainly as businessmen and also in agriculture. Other migrants arrived before and during World War I and later the 1948 Palestine war. By origin they primarily came from the cities of Beit Jala, Bethlehem, and Beit Sahour. Most of these early migrants were Christians. They typically landed at Argentine ports, and crossed the Andes by mule into Chile. Chilean Palestinians are often erroneously but also intentionally called turcos (Spanish for Turks) after the Ottoman nationality that early immigrants had on their passports. Contrary to the immigration of Germans and other European nationalities, the immigration of Palestinians was not considered beneficial by Chilean intellectuals, and was even, alongside Chinese and Japanese immigration, questioned.The arrival of the Palestinian immigrants to Chile in the early 20th century happened at the same time the Chilean state stopped sponsoring immigration to Chile and the country suffered a severe social and economic crisis coupled with a wave of nationalism with xenophobic and racist undertones. Immigrants were also at times treated in highly denigrating terms by the Chilean press; for example, El Mercurio wrote in 1911: Whether they are Mohammedans or Buddhists, what one can see and smell from far, is that they are more dirty than the dogs of Constantinople... \u2014 El Mercurio, April 13, 1911. Many of the immigrants were very poor and illiterate and had to take loans to pay their travel costs. Once in Chile, Palestinians settled largely in the marginal areas of cities and worked as small merchants. In the 1950s by the time of the second government of Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo many Palestinian-Chileans had acquired substantial economic as well as political power in Chile, some working as deputies, ministers or ambassadors. Aside from these migrants of previous decades, Chile has also taken in some Palestinian refugees in later years, as in April 2008 when it received 117 from the Al-Waleed refugee camp on the Syria\u2013Iraq border near the Al-Tanf crossing. All of those refugees were Sunni Muslims. People who hold a Diplomatic or Official Palestinian Passport can visit Chile as tourists for up to 90 days, without a Visa. The vast majority of the Palestinian community in Chile follow Christianity. The largest denomination is Orthodox Christian followed by Roman Catholic, and in fact, the number of Palestinian Christians in the diaspora in Chile alone exceeds the number of those who have remained in their homeland. One early Palestinian church in Santiago, the Iglesia Ortodoxa San Jorge, was founded in 1917. Some Palestinians in Chile are Sunni Muslims. The Club Palestino is one of the most prestigious social clubs in Santiago; it offers swimming, tennis, and dining facilities to its members. There is also a soccer team, C.D.Palestino, whose uniform is in the traditional Palestinian colours red, green, and white. The team has been champion of the Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n twice. Also, some Chilean-Palestinian footballers like Roberto Bishara and Alexis Norambuena have played for the Palestine national football team. Other Chileans of Palestinian origin, such as Luis Antonio Jim\u00e9nez, played international football for Chile and several foreign clubs. A number of Palestinians in Chile have shown significant concern with the situation of Palestine, for example, the president of the C\u00e1mara de Comercio (chamber of commerce) of the Barrio Patronato, himself a Palestinian, in 2006 organised a protest regarding the 2006 Lebanon War; Lebanese and Palestinian flags were widely seen inthe neighbourhood's streets at that time. On another occasion, outside the Club Palestino and again in front of the Colegio \u00c1rabe, someone wrote on the sidewalk \"\u00c1rabe=terrorismo\" (\"Arabs=terrorism\") and \"Palestina no existe\" (\"Palestine does not exist\").<PIC> A number of Chilean novels have featured Palestinian characters and discussed the experience of Palestinian immigrants in the country, such as El viajero de la alfombra m\u00e1gica by Walter Garib, Los turcos by Roberto Sarah, and Peregrino de ojos brillantes, by Jaime Hales.

The origins of the name date back to feudal times and refer to the usual and customary contributions ('costumi') that the denizens were expected to forward to the baronial landowners. The Costumarii were the local townsmen entrusted with this act. In modern times Costumi is principally known for four diffused clusters of residences, each surrounded by woodlots and farmers' grain fields. These groups of houses are named San Pietro ad Azzano, Case Mancine, Villa Sciarra, and Colle Sansonesco. Data collected during the 12th census on 25 October 1981 provide the following population figures for Costumi: 38 families 63 men 68 women 131 inhabitants The local parish church of Costumi is Saint Peters (San Pietro), located in nearby Azzano. This area formerly hosted a monastery, which later became a parish church. In medieval times a large feudal estate named University (Universit\u00e0) was located here, an ancient term given to the various communes comprising a large domain. The historian Bernardino Delfico posits that the word Azzano derives from the ancient gens Attia.Many people with the last name Attia (and its derivatives such as Attio, Attiano and Attia) live or have lived in this locality. The monastery (later a parish church) that was located in this area was administered by the Abbey of Farfa. It enjoyed the privileges and riches that accompanied this designation at least until the 19th century. This cluster of homes is located between San Pietro ad Azzano and Ioanella. This small cluster of houses is located between Colle Sansonesco and Ioanella. From this location one has a panoramic view of the Gran Sasso and the surrounding mountain chain. In historical documents related Colle Sansonesco the area is sometimes referred to by various names include Collesansonesco, Collo Sansonesco, and Colle Santonesco. The famous historian Niccola Palma attributesthe name of this area to a family called Sansone who were the likely owners. Luigi Ercole in the beginning of the 1800s wrote about Colle Sansonesco in this way: This is a small village located about three miles southeast of Teramo. It has 32 residents. The land is steep and mountainous. The main local product is acorns although grain and vineyards are also to be found....\" In the Regio Cedolario del 1787 (Royal Taxation Decree of 1787) the area is designated a feudo nobile, (noble feudal holding) i.e., a large aristocratic feud with certain delineated rights and responsibilities. Past census data provide an interesting perspective into the area's history. Residents were grouped into fuochi (fireplaces) with the implication that each fireplace served as a gathering place for one family unit. Thus a village having twenty \"fuochi\" had approximately this many families residing there at the time. Colle Sansonesco was originally considered to be an outlying villa associated with the town, and belonging to baron, of Teramo. Only later was it designated a Universit\u00e0 (University), that is, a commune making up part of a domain, and not forming part of the baronial holdings.This nomenclature was used in the Kingdom of Naples and certain of other states which later came together to form what is now known as modern Italy. According to the 1754 census (Catasto Onciario) data: Nuclear families: 7 (for a total of 48 people) Absent families: 1 Non-clergy associated with the church: 2 Churches and related properties: Madonna delle Grazie; San Pietro di Azzano; San Giacomo; Parish of Collesansonesco; Non-citizen overseers: 2 A small church, San Donato, is located in Colle Sansonesco. Nearby there is also an even smaller chapel dedicated to the Madonna delle Grazie. These holdings lie within the parochial boundaries of San Pietro ad Azzano.<PIC> In the 1920s Colle Sansonesco was chosen as the location on which was to be built a sanatorium for the city of Teramo for the This area, about 1 mile from the city center, is located on a gentle slope at a slightly higher elevation than Teramo and is easily reachable by foot or by public transport. The development of this new project was awarded to a local engineer, Alfonso De Albentiis. The first contracts were approved in November 1927. Work was completed in 1934 when the facility was first opened to the public. In order to further freshen the air, a great number of pine trees were planted in the vicinity of the sanatorium. The structure today functions as a geriatriccenter and, thanks to the pine saplings that were planted 70 years ago, sits amidst a stand of majestic pines trees.", "images": ["w_s1021"], "tokens": 1125}]}

The planetarium is located at 8 Rue des Acadiens in Butte Sainte-Anne. It is near the bank of the Loire, in the Square Moisan and the neighborhood Bellevue - Chantenay - Sainte-Anne. The planetarium can not be visited as a museum, it offers commented sessions of about an hour (as in the cinema but live). Each session, is scheduled in advanced and adapted to a certain type of public, according to the age or the level of knowledge. Under a dome 8 meters (26 ft) in diameter, the planetarium can accommodate 59 spectators and accommodate about 60,000 visitors per year, school or the general public. In the lobby, there are three large meteorites (36 kg or 79 lbs for the heaviest) that the public can touch, showcases exposing several fragments of various types of meteorites, models putting various robots in situation on the soil of Mars, Venus, the Moon, Titan (moon of Saturn) and on a comet, planetary globes, rockets, the International Space Station, probes like Juno (around Jupiter) or the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope, and other rovers.The planetarium is equipped with a mobile planetarium (an inflatable structure 5 to 6 meters in diameter and 3 meters high) designed for the introduction to astronomy for use in schools. The Planetarium of Nantes also weaves a network among the local actors like the Laboratory of planetology of the University of Nantes, the Museum of natural history, the science and environment pole Sequoia, the Society of Astronomy of Nantes, the association \"Meridienne\", and many others, all working in the field of research or scientific mediation including astronomy. In 1979, the City of Nantes decided to build a planetarium. At that time in France, there was only one large planetarium in at the Palais de la d\u00e9couverte and 3 small planetariums in Reims, ENAC Toulouse, and Marseille. The planetarium in Nantes was to be built on theupper part of Square Moisan, which was abandoned at this time. Opened to the public on June 18, 1981, the planetarium is equipped with a Carl Zeiss projector, model ZKP2 identical to that of Reims, Nimes (which will open a year later) and Marseille (which will burn quickly). Between 1999 and 2000, the City of Nantes expanded the premises with two offices of 9m2 (97 ft2), which allows to expand the lobby and install some models and collections of meteorites. In the autumn of 2005, for approximately 480,000 euros, the opto-mechanical projector Zeiss was replaced by a digital type installation and the City of Nantes has offered its former planetary Zeiss at the National University of C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina ). At that time, there were only 3 planetariums in France using Evans & Sutherland's Digistar II fisheye (Vaulx-en-Velin, Pleumeur-Bodou and Toulouse), and Saint-\u00c9tienne experimenting with multi-video projectors. Nantes is the first planetarium in the world to install five video projectors (to cover the entire vault) DLP type in a medium dome. Since the 1990s, some pioneers have been developing digital installations to replace opto-mechanical star projectors.Digital installations consist of installing video projectors in the dome, computers and software (astronomical simulator) to reconstruct the observable Universe data astronomical catalogs constructed by data from astrometric satellites, such as Hipparcos (about 120,000 positioned stars) or Gaia (spacecraft) (more than 1 million objects). This makes it possible to move in a universe volume in three dimensions, in real time or to \"travel\" in time. If the simulator is well built, it can also travel from planets to planets and land there. In the fall of 2013, the Nantes Planetarium closed for refurbishment work: change of video projectors, computers and software for around 500,000 euros. These two months of closure to the public have refreshed the chairs, redo the painting of the dome and re-arrange the lobby of the public. As a result of the transformation of the urban community into Metropole, it becomes a metropolitan facility between January 2015 and January 2016.<PIC> Before this crisis, renovations were planned for fall 2020, but it did not go as planned. The Planetarium remained closed for 16 months. The initial works provided for the change of the carpet, the paintings, the renewal of the seats, the displacement of the console outside the perimeter of the room allowing the addition of eight new places, a new airlock allowing a discreet exit without flooding of light the spectators plunged into darkness. But the additional work made it possible to change the entire air conditioning system. The Planetarium reopened for its 40th anniversary on July 3, 2021. This small municipal square of 690 m2 (7,400 sq ft) located between the back of the planetarium and the Rue de l'Hermitage, has in its center a set of sculptures, including a giant sundial, made by Jean-Michel Ansel, sundial maker, entitled Structures astronomiques, representing the movement of the Earth around the Sun, eclipses of the Moon and the Sun, the retrograde movement of Mars, the sunshine of the Earth in real time, the planets scaled to each other etc.This square is accessible either by the staircase located between Misery street and Hermitage street, or from the Acadiens street bypassing the planetarium.", "images": ["w_s1029"], "tokens": 1299}]}

They can be seen as the three-dimensional relatives of the superellipses. The term may refer to the solid object or to its surface, depending on the context. The equations below specify the surface; the solid is specified by replacing the equality signs by less-than-or-equal signs. The superquadrics include many shapes that resemble cubes, octahedra, cylinders, lozenges and spindles, with rounded or sharp corners. Because of their flexibility and relative simplicity, they are popular geometric modeling tools, especially in computer graphics. Some authors, such as Alan Barr, define \"superquadrics\" as including both the superellipsoids and the supertoroids. However, the (proper) supertoroids are not superquadrics as defined above; and, while some superquadrics are superellipsoids, neither family is contained in the other.Comprehensive coverage of geometrical properties of superquadrics and a method of their recovery from range images is covered in a monograph.<PIC> The surface of the basic superquadric is given by \\left|x\\right|^{r}+\\left|y\\right|^{s}+\\left|z\\right|^{t}=1 where r, s, and t are positive real numbers that determine the main features of the superquadric.

It gave rise to the Trans-Hudson orogen (THO), or Trans-Hudson Orogen Transect (THOT), (also referred to as the Trans-Hudsonian Suture Zone (THSZ) or Trans-Hudson suture) which is the largest Paleoproterozoic orogenic belt in the world. It consists of a network of belts that were formed by Proterozoic crustal accretion and the collision of pre-existing Archean continents. The event occurred 2.0\u20131.8 billion years ago. The Trans-Hudson orogen sutured together the Hearne-Rae, Superior, and Wyoming cratons to form the cratonic core of North America in a network of Paleoproterozoic orogenic belts. These orogenic belts include the margins of at least nine independent microcontinents that were themselves sections of at least three former major supercontinents, including Laurasia, Pangaea and Kenorland (ca.2.7 Ga), and contain parts of some of the oldest cratonic continental crust on Earth. These old cratonic blocks, along with accreted island arc terranes and intraoceanic deposits from earlier Proterozoic and Mesozoic oceans and seaways, were sutured together in the Trans-Hudson Orogen (THO) and resulted in extensive folding and thrust faulting along with metamorphism and hundreds of huge granitic intrusions. The THO is a right-angled suture zone that extends eastward from Saskatchewan through collisional belts in the Churchill province, through northern Quebec, parts of Labrador and Baffin Island, and all the way to Greenland as the Rinkian belt and Nagssugtodidian Orogen. Westward it goes across Hudson Bay through Saskatchewan and then extends 90 degrees south through eastern Montana and the western Dakotas, downward through eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska, and is then cut off by the Cheyenne belt - the northern edge of the Yavapai province (see Trans-Hudson Orogen map and the THOT Transect map. To the south, the orogen contributed to the subsurface Phanerozoic strata in Montana and the Dakotas that created the Great Plains. The Trans-Hudson orogeny was the culminating event of the Paleoproterozoic Laurentian assembly, which occurred after the Wopmay orogeny (West of Hudson Bay, ca. 2.1-1.9 Ga.). The Trans-Hudson orogeny resulted from the collision of the Superior Craton of eastern Canada with the Hearne Craton in northern Saskatchewan and the Wyoming Craton of the western United States, with the Archean microcontinent Sask Craton trapped in the THO western interior. Similar to the Himalayas, the Trans-Hudson orogeny was also the result of continent-continent collision along a suture zone. Only the roots of this mountain chain remain, but these can be seen in northeastern Saskatchewan and in the Black Hills of South Dakota.The Trans-Hudson orogeny and the consequent upheaval of the continental crust in the middle Proterozoic eon caused the area around the Great Lakes to become a flattened plain, which in turn led to the creation of the intracontinental basin and the interior and central plains of the United States (the Great Plains are the westernmost portion of North America's Interior Plains, which extend east to the Appalachian Plateau). The Black Hills of South Dakota is one of the few remaining exposed portions of the Trans-Hudson orogenic belt. The peaks of the Black Hills are 3,000 to 4,000 feet above the surrounding plains, while Black Elk Peak - the highest point in South Dakota - has an altitude of 7,242 feet above sea level. These central spires and peaks all are carved from granite and other igneous and metamorphic rocks that form the core of the uplift. The nature and timing of this portion of the THO event in southern Laurentia is poorly understood, when compared to the exposed northern segments in Canada. The Black Hills offer the only surface exposure of the deformed and metamorphosed belt of Paleoproterozoic continental margin rocks in the collisional zone between the Archean Wyoming and Superior provinces. Based on geophysical evidence, this zone has been broadly interpreted to be the southern extension of the THO that was later truncated by the ~1.680 Ga. Central Plains orogen.<PIC> Marine evidence indicates that the area initially opened to form an ocean called the Manikewan Ocean. Faulting, sedimentary and igneous rocks all indicate that divergence formed a rift valley that continued to spread until it resulted in a passive margin in which there was no tectonic activity. Shallow marine deposits formed on the continental shelves, and oceanic crust formed on the margins of the continental cratons as the divergence continued. Eventually the divergence stopped, then reversed direction, and collision occurred between continental land masses. During the Wopmay orogeny, subduction occurred as oceanic crust of the Slave Craton was subducted beneath an eastward moving continental plate. Likewise, during the Trans-Hudson orogeny, rifting at first separated the Superior craton from the rest of the continent.Gold mineralization has been less studied, but at Reed Lake has been shown to be associated with late brittle-ductile shear zones that follow peak tectonic and metamorphic activity within the Trans-Hudson Orogen. At Snow Lake, preliminary investigations suggest a long history of gold mineralization with at least some gold introduced prior to metamorphism.", "images": ["w_s1110"], "tokens": 1415}]}

It was founded in 1923 in memory of Lauren Eastman Rogers. The building's architect was Rathbone DeBuys of New Orleans, Louisiana. The museum has an extensive collection of Native American baskets. It also has a selection of American art by Winslow Homer, Albert Bierstadt, and John Singer Sargent. It receives 32,000 visitors a year. The Lauren Rogers Museum of Art was opened in 1923 as a memorial to Lauren Eastman Rogers, the only son and only grandson of two of the town's founding families. Lauren died at the age of 23 in 1921 from complications of appendicitis, just months after marrying Lelia Hodson Rogers. After his death, Lauren's father, Wallace Brown Rogers, and his maternal grandfather, Lauren Chase Eastman, created the Eastman Memorial Foundation \"to promote the public welfare by founding, endowing and having maintained a public library, museum, art gallery and educational institution, within the state of Mississippi.\" The museum opened its doors on May 1, 1923 in a building that was originally being constructed to be Lauren and Lelia's private residence.The Eastman, Gardiner and Rogers families had migrated to Laurel, Mississippi, from Clinton, Iowa, in the 1890s for timber resources. Their influence was fundamental in the formation of the city of Laurel. The Rogers family built large residences on broad avenues in Laurel, and the family helped lay the foundation for public parks and schools that served the city for many generations. Lauren Rogers was being groomed by his parents and grandparents to take over the family lumber business and continue the families philanthropic legacy in Laurel. The Rogers and Eastman families did not let Lauren's legacy die with him. Instead, they created Lauren's legacy for him through the establishing of this museum in his honor. Throughout the years the museum has served various purposes. The original building not only served as an art gallery, but it also housed the town library. The first collection featured in the museum gallery was a large basket collection that was donated in 1923 by Lauren Rogers' great-aunt, Catherine Marshall Gardiner. A new wing was completed in 1925 giving the museum five art galleries on the first floor and space for the Laurel Library Association on the lower level, where they stayed until 1979. These new galleries were eventually filled with nineteenth- and twentieth-century paintings that were donated by the Rogers and Eastman families. This collection which includes works by famous artists such as Winslow Homer, Albert Bierstadt, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet became a part of the museum's permanent collection and can still be seen today. In 1953 Lelia Rogers added a Reading Room and filled it with furniture from her in-laws home and a portrait of her deceased husband, Lauren. The building itself is a piece of art that has stood the test of time. The building's architect was Rathbone DeBuys of New Orleans, Louisiana. The interior was designed by the Chicago firm of Watson and Walton.The walls are paneled in quarter-sawn golden oak, accented by hand-wrought ironwork by Samuel Yellin, and a ceiling of hand-molded plaster done by master craftsman Leon Hermant. The original museum floors were cork and has been continued throughout the various additions. The collection of the Lauren Rogers Museum of Art consists of five specialized collections: American art, European paintings, Native American baskets, Japanese Ukiyo-e prints, and British Georgian silver. American Art One of the largest of these is our collection of American paintings, sculptures, and works on paper. The core of the collection is a group of 19th and 20th-century paintings donated by Lauren Chase Eastman, the grandfather of Lauren Rogers, in the 1920s and 1930s. Some of our most important works came from this astute collector, and many other important works were donated by Lauren Rogers\u2019 parents, Nina and Wallace B. Rogers. These collectors focused on the landscape and portraiture traditions which have been such an important part of the history of American art. Most of the works are intimate in size, reflecting their origins in private collections, which were on display in private homes. Landscape paintings in the Museum collection date primarily from the late 19th century onward. The Museum owns late examples of Hudson River School painting, the first group of painters to exclusively focus on and celebrate the American landscape. Artists such as John Frederick Kensett and Albert Bierstadt, whose works are on display in the American gallery, are typical of this movement. These artists were inspired by the Romantic movement in art and literature and strove to glorify the wonders of nature through their art. The American Impressionists of the early 20th century used the image of the landscape as a means of personal expression as well as a vehicle for exploring the medium of painting itself. Artists like John Henry Twachtman chose to portray intimate settings and quiet places in his pictures, some of which border on the abstract in their painterly quality and emphasis on color and light over form and drawing. Since the 1930s, the Museum has added more modern landscape paintings, particularly by Mississippi artists like Marie Hull and William Dunlap.We continue to build on this fine collection of American landscapes. British Georgian Silver Most of the works in the British Georgian Silver Collection were donated to the Museum by the late Harriet and Thomas Gibbons. From the mid-1920s until 1959, Mr. Gibbons was the publisher of the Laurel Leader-Call, and Mrs. Gibbons was the editor. Both had a passion for silver which resulted in a magnificent and well-focused collection of silver luxury goods, most used in relation to English \u201chigh tea.\u201d The term \u201cGeorgian\u201d refers to the period between 1714 and 1830 when four KingGeorges in a row ruled England. This time span saw a change in style; during the early 18th-century, English silver featured the abundant ornamentation of the Baroque and Rococo periods. By the end of the Georgian period, a restrained Neo-Classical style held sway, inspired by Classical forms and designs from ancient Greece and Rome. European Art The Museum owns approximately 65 European works of art, dating from the 17th to the 20th centuries. The core of the collection are 24 works donated by the Eastman and Rogers families during the early years of the Museum\u2019s existence. These include important, internationally known works like Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet\u2019s First Steps, an 1856 pastel which later inspired Vincent van Gogh; Landscape Near Paris (c.1885) by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, considered one of the first modernist painters; and other influential early 19th-century painters. The earliest work in the collection is an etching by Rembrandt van Rijn entitled Virgin and Child with Cat (1654), which depicts Mary and the infant Jesus in domestic interior.According to legend, the cat of the Madonna produced a litter of kittens in the stable where Christ was born; the cat of legend crouches next to the Madonna, as Joseph looks in through a window. This tiny etching is one of many Biblical illustrations produced by Rembrandt. Japanese Woodblock Prints The Japanese Gallery contains examples of ukiyo-e woodblock prints from the Edo Period (1600-1868). The term ukiyo-e means \u201cimages of the floating world.\u201d This is a reference to the theater and entertainment districts of urban Japan, especially those in Kyoto and Tokyo (then known as Edo). The most popular subjects were those of leisure and pleasure: images of courtesans and actors, of erotica and of the Kabuki theater. Later, artists would adapt the ukiyo-e style that had been honed on these subjects to the depiction of landscapes, as in Hiroshige\u2019s album of prints, Thirty-Six Views of Fuji (c.1828-33). Native American Art Around 1900, Catherine Marshall Gardiner of Laurel, Mississippi, read an article about Native American baskets and found herself tempted by the possibility of collecting them. Her husband, George Schuyler Gardiner, encouraged her to \u201cgo as far as she liked.\u201d The Gardiners, the great-aunt and great-uncle of Lauren Rogers, moved to Laurel in the 1890s to establish a lumber company after the lumber business in their home state of Iowa had begun to slow. At first she planned to collect only contemporary baskets, but, she said, \u201cthe lure of old and fine work specimens soon gained the ascendancy.\u201d When she embarked on this project, she little realized she would become one of the premier collectors of the period, often called \u201cthe golden age of basket collecting.\u201d Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s quest for fine specimens led her to contact and visit basket dealers, other collectors, officials and teachers on reservations, and weavers, eventually becoming part of a national network of other basket aficionados.

Over ten years later, Mrs.Gardiner wrote, \u201cIt has been a work of great charm.\u201d In the intervening decades, the Lauren Rogers Museum of Art has added to the collection, particularly with baskets from the Southeast, but Mrs. Gardiner \u2019s vision has remained the foundation of the collection. Humans have been making baskets for thousands of years; it is a craft that is common to all cultures. Today\u2019s Native American basket makers work within a tradition that is centuries old. For example, there are Choctaw weavers in Mississippi who are fifth generation basket weavers, following a tradition passed down from mother to daughter over many decades.<PIC> As the city of laurel has grown and changed so has the Museum grown and changed over the years. In the last 35 years the museum has received a few updates in architecture, as well as, in artistic holdings. In 1983 the museum received an addition designed by Micheal Foil, that included a new gallery for visiting collections and beautiful grand staircase made from Tennessee black marble. In more recent years, a large Chihuly piece has been added above this staircase. Another addition was completed in 2013 adding the Sanderson Gallery. The museum continues to serve the community through various events and ongoing educational programs. The museum has several events such as the annual Blues Bash and Museum Gala. During the summer months the museum holds art camps and free family art days. In addition to events on museum property, the museum also goes to various places in the community such as city centers and holds Artreach art camps. In 2018, the Lauren Rogers Museum of Art celebrated its 95th year of operation. The museum strives daily to continue the legacy that the Rogers, Eastman, and Gardiner families began in 1923. This, however, would not be possible without the continued support of donors and patrons. Admission to the museum is free, but donations are encouraged.

After winning Superleague Greece with Olympiakos in 2014, he signed with Benfica in Portugal for \u20ac10 million. With them, he has won four Primeira Liga, one Ta\u00e7a de Portugal, two Ta\u00e7a da Liga and two Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira. A full international since 2013, Samaris represented Greece at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Samaris started his career in Gamma Ethniki side Panachaiki in 2006, making a total of 37 league appearances and scored three goals for the club. On 10 April 2007, he signed his first professional contract with Panachaiki, where he was coached by future Australia national team manager Ange Postecoglou. On 11 January 2010, Samaris moved to Panionios. Samaris joined Olympiacos in 2012 but spent the season on loan at Panionios. In 2013, he returned to Olympiacos and scored his first goal with the club on 23 November 2013, in an away 4\u20131 victory against Panthrakikos. Samaris ended the league with 38 appearances and scored four goals en route to the Greeks' 41st title.On 22 August 2014, Samaris moved abroad and joined Portuguese champions Benfica on a five-year contract for a transfer fee of \u20ac10 million and with a \u20ac45 million release clause. He made his debut for Benfica on 12 September against Vit\u00f3ria S\u00e9tubal. At the end of the 2014\u201315 season, Samaris mentioned that the Portuguese language was a barrier in his first year with the club. The Greek international stressed the importance of learning it by stating, \"I liked to learn Portuguese because I became closer to my colleagues. The most important is to understand what my coach says because there was an idea of game and I had to adapt faster than the others.\" On 29 August 2015, in the second day of 2015\u201316 Primeira Liga, Samaris, after an assist from Greek teammate Kostas Mitroglou, scored with a right-footed shot from outside the box to the bottom left corner, the second goal giving the lead to his club in a 3\u20132 win against Moreirense. It was his first goal in the Primeira Liga. On 1 April 2016, he scored his second goal in the Portuguese league, with a direct free kick, in a 5\u20131 home game against Braga. On 4 March 2017, in a 1\u20130 away game against C.D. Feirense, Samaris reached 100 appearances with the jersey of Benfica. In that season, he also played in the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal final, which Benfica won over Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es (2\u20131). On 11 March 2019, Samaris scored a volley in a league match, giving his team a two-goal lead in an eventual 2\u20132 home draw to Belenenses. It was his first goal in the 2018\u201319 season in all competitions. On 14 May, he extended his contract with Benfica until 2023. On 21 July 2021, Andreas Samaris starts training with Benfica\u2019s B team today. The 32-year-old Greek international midfielder is not part of Jorge Jesus\u2019 plans and has refused all Benfica\u2019s attempts to negotiate a mutually agreed termination of the contract that runs until 2023. Eventually on 31 August 2021, Samaris agreed with the club for the termination of his contractagainst Romania. After a strong season with Olympiakos, Santos opted to select Samaris to his final 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. On 24 June 2014, in his first appearance in a final tournament of the World Cup and against the Ivory Coast, Samaris opened the scoring after capitalizing on Cheick Tiot\u00e9's defensive mistake in the 42nd minute in an eventual 2\u20131 victory; Samaris came on as an early replacement for the injured Panagiotis Kone.

The phrase is commonly used to describe rape of inmates by other inmates, or to describe rape of inmates by staff. In February 2021, BBC News reported eyewitness accounts of systematic rape of Uyghur women in the Xinjiang internment camps. Multiple women who were formerly detained in the Xinjiang internment camps have publicly made accusations of systemic sexual abuse, including rape. Sayragul Sauytbay, a teacher who was forced to work in the camps, told the BBC that employees of the camp in which she was detained conducted rapes en masse, saying that camp guards \"picked the girls and young women they wanted and took them away\". She also told the BBC of an organized gang rape, in which a woman around age 21 was forced to make a confession in front of a crowd of 100 other women detained in the camps, before being raped by multiple policemen in front of the assembled crowd.Tursunay Ziawudun, a woman who was detained in the camps for a period of nine months, told the BBC that women were removed from their cells \"every night\" to be raped by Chinese men, and that she was subjected to three separate instances of gang rape while detained. Qelbinur Sedik, an Uzbek woman from Xinjiang, has stated that Chinese police sexually abused detainees during electric shock tortures, saying that \"there were four kinds of electric shock... the chair, the glove, the helmet, and anal rape with a stick\". Sexual violence against political prisoners is prevalent in Iran. It is allegedly ignored or even facilitated by authorities. Reports issued to the United Nations allege that rape has been used by interrogators in Iran for decades. During the 1980s, following the Iranian Islamic Revolution, the rape of female political prisoners was so prevalent that it prompted Hussein-Ali Montazeri, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini's then-deputy, to write the following to Khomeini in a letter dated 7 October 1986: \"Did you know that young women are raped in some of the prisons of the Islamic Republic?\" Two prominent members of Iran's human rights community, the feminist lawyer and journalist Shadi Sadr and the blogger and activist Mojtaba Saminejad published essays online from inside Iran saying prison rape has a long history in the Islamic Republic. In the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, opposition groups reported thousands were arrested and tortured in prisons around the country, with former inmates alleging mass rape of men, women and children by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, in prisons such as Kahrizak and Evin. Following the 2009 presidential election, Iranian presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said several protesters held behind bars in Evin Prison had been savagely raped, according to a confidential letter to former president and cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Karroubi said this was a \"fragment\" of the evidence he had and that if the denials did not stop, he would release even more. On 9 August 2009, in a letter to the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran, Mehdi Karroubi demanded investigation of Iranian prisons for possible torture and, in particular, sexual harassment of men and women.On 19 August, he wrote to parliament speaker Ali Larijani, asking to meet with him, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the state prosecutor to \"personally present my documents and evidence over the cases of sexual abuse in some prisons specially Kahrizak.\" Ali Larijani and Sadeq Larijani (Judiciary committee) both officially rejected his claims and Ali Khamenei's representatives, and Vice Chairman of National Security Commission of the parliament demanded Karroubi's arrest. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have both released reports of widespread rape and abuse of prisoners in Turkey spanning multiple decades. Kurdish prisoners have also been specifically targeted for rape and other forms of sexual violence. Rape is regularly used in prisons across the wider Middle East. Sexual abuse of detained women, children and men is rampant in UAE, Saudi and Bahraini prisons. In the United States, the overwhelming majority of prison rape cases involve men who are raped by other men. This is due in part to the fact that in the United States the vast majority of incarcerated people are men. Sexual contact with inmates by prison staff is illegal, regardless of supposed consent. Public awareness of common prison rape is a relatively recent development, and estimates of its prevalence have varied widely over the past several decades. In 1974, Carl Weiss and David James Friar wrote that 46 million Americans would one day be incarcerated; of that number, they held that 10 million would be raped. According to a US Department of Justice report from 2013, an estimated 5.0% of people incarcerated in state and federal prison, and 3.2% of those in jail, reported at least one incident of sexual victimization in the prior 12 months. However, advocates dispute the accuracy of the numbers due to under-reporting of sexual assaults in prison, especially among incarcerated youths.In terms of individuals' risk over their entire incarceration, estimates from the 1980s and 1990s range widely. A 1992 estimate from the Federal Bureau of Prisons suggested that between 9 and 20% of inmates had been sexually assaulted. Similarly, studies from 1982 and 1996, concluded that the rate was somewhere between 12% and 14%. In New York State maximum security prisons, a 1986 study put the proportion at around 23%. By contrast, Christine Saum's 1994 survey of 101 inmates determined that 5 had been sexually assaulted. The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 was the first United States federal law passed specifically dealing with the sexual assault of prisoners. The bill was signed into law on 4 September 2003.<PIC>", "images": ["w_s1139"], "tokens": 1397}]}

The experiment probes the dynamics of long-pulse, collisionless, low s-parameter field-reversed configurations (FRCs) formed with odd-parity rotating magnetic fields. It aims to experimentally verify the physics predictions that such configurations are globally stable and have transport levels comparable with classical magnetic diffusion. It also aims to apply this technology to the Direct Fusion Drive concept for spacecraft propulsion. The PFRC was initially funded by the United States Department of Energy. Early in its operation it was contemporary with such RMF-FRCs as the Translation Confinement Sustainment experiment (TCS) and the Prairie View Rotamak (PV Rotamak). At PPPL, the experiment PFRC-1 ran from 2008 through 2011. PFRC-2 is running as of 2019. PFRC-3 is scheduled next. PFRC-4 is scheduled for the mid-2020s.The electrical current that forms the field-reversed configuration (FRC) in the PFRC is driven by a rotating magnetic field (RMF). This method has been well-studied and produced favorable results in the Rotamak series of experiments. However, rotating magnetic fields as applied in these and other experiments (so-called even parity RMFs) induce opening of the magnetic field lines. When a transverse magnetic field is applied to the axisymmetric equilibrium FRC magnetic field, rather than magnetic field lines closing on themselves and forming a closed region, they spiral around in the azimuthal direction and ultimately cross the separatrix surface which contains the closed FRC region. The PFRC uses RMF antennae which produce a magnetic field which changes direction about a symmetry plane oriented with its normal along the axis, half-way along the length of the axis of the machine. This configuration is called an odd parity rotating magnetic field. Such magnetic fields, when added in small magnitude to axisymmetric equilibrium magnetic fields, do not cause opening of the magnetic field lines and overall topology is preserved. The critical threshold magnitude of 'odd parity' rotating magnetic field, which opens up the axisymmetric equilibrium magnetic field lines, and fundamentally changes field topology is rather high. Thus, the RMF is not expected to contribute to transport of particles and energy out of the core of the PFRC.<PIC> In an FRC, the name s-parameter is given to the ratio of the distance between the magnetic null and the separatrix, and the thermal ion Larmor radius. That is how many ion orbits can fit between the core of the FRC and where it meets the bulk plasma. A high-s FRC would have very small ion gyroradii compared to the size of the machine. Thus, at high s-parameter, the model of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) applies. MHD predicts that the FRC is unstable to the \"n=1 tilt mode,\" in which the reversed field tilts 180 degrees to align with the applied magnetic field, destroying the FRC. A low-s FRC is predicted to be stable to the tilt mode.ce electric power and propulsion from a single compact fusion reactor. The first concept study and modeling (Phase I) was published in 2017, and was proposed to power the propulsion system of a Pluto orbiter and lander. Adding propellant to the cool plasma flow results in a variable thrust when channeled through a magnetic nozzle. Modeling suggests that the DFD might produce 5 Newtons of thrust per each megawatt of generated fusion power.

Its bell tower has been a landmark in Washington County for over a century. It is designated as a historic public landmark by the Washington County History & Landmarks Foundation. The historic section of the school was once Trinity Hall School for Boys that operated from 1879 to 1906. The historic school grounds in North Franklin Township date back to the 1850s when Joseph McKnight built a home on top of a hill overlooking the then-borough of Washington, Pennsylvania. This twenty-five room Italianate mansion called Spring Hill now functions as the district's administrative offices connected to Trinity High School. Spring Hill was purchased by William Smith, a prominent Washington dry goods merchant, as the new home for his son. The Smith family hired Boston-based landscape artist Robert Morris Copeland to prepare the grounds along Catfish Creek before it was occupied by William Wrenshaw Smith and his wife Emma Willard McKennan Smith. Wrenshaw Smith was a cousin to Julia Dent, wife of President Ulysses S. Grant. Wrenshaw Smith also served as Grant's aide-de-camp during the Civil War and Grant visited the Spring Hill mansion on multiple occasions.William Wrenshaw Smith was a devout Episcopalian and longtime vestryman at Trinity Episcopal Church, then located on Beau Street near Washington and Jefferson College. During the 1860s, Smith worked alongside John Barrett Kerfoot, newly elected Bishop of Pittsburgh, to create a boys\u2019 school following the curricular model of famed priest-educator William Augustus Muhlenberg. In this model, \u201cthe school was to be like a large family with a priest as rector serving as father-figure in loco parentis.\u201d Trinity Hall operated from 1870 to 1906 attracting members of prominent regional families including Heinz, Carnegie, Kammerer, and LeMoyne along with a grandson of President Grant. In 1883, Trinity School for Boys began adopting elements of Muscular Christianity. This included a \u201cmilitary department\u201d for purposes of exercise and a more generic Protestant Christianity in place of Muhlenberg's strictly Episcopalian church school model. Sometimes this leads to overemphasis on the military nature of the school and mistaken conclusions that Trinity Hall was a strict military academy. Various Episcopal priests served as school rector until the 1890s when patron William Wrenshaw Smith became lay rector, a change possibly due to declining enrollment and revenue. Trinity Hall closed in 1906, two years after Smith's death. Trinity Hall, a Smith family property, stood vacant for nearly two decades. In 1922, it was unsuccessfully considered as a site for relocating Presbyterian-affiliated Washington Female Seminary. Then in 1925 the townships of Amwell, Canton, North Franklin, and South Strabane purchased the Trinity Hall property to repurpose as a joint public high school. The sale nearly fell through. Amwell Township's secretary refused to sign documents until forced to do so by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The classroom block of Trinity Hall was used from 1883 until 2004. It was demolished in 2006. The Spring Hill section of Trinity Hall continues to serve as offices for Trinity Area School District.Today, Trinity is a modern public school housing approximately 1,279 students in grades 9\u201312 on a campus-style setting. Trinity Area School District maintains a small Trinity Hall Museum open by appointment only. Trinity High School offers a wide variety of extracurricular activities and sports. Football, baseball, basketball, soccer, cross-country, track, wrestling, volleyball, golf, rifle, lacrosse, ice hockey, swimming, softball, tennis, and cheerleading are available at Trinity.

The 2015 Venezuelan film Gone with the River was spoken in Warao. Warao appears to be a language isolate, unrelated to any recorded language in the region or elsewhere. Terrence Kaufman (1994) included it in his hypothetical Macro-Paezan family, but the necessary supporting work was never done. Julian Granberry connected many of the grammatical forms, including nominal and verbal suffixes, of Warao to the Timucua language of North Florida, also a language isolate. However, he has also derived Timucua morphemes from Muskogean, Chibchan, Paezan, Arawakan, and other Amazonian languages, suggesting multi-language creolization as a possible explanation for these similarities.Granberry also finds \"Waroid\" vocabulary items in Guajiro (from toponymic evidence it seems that the Warao or a related people once occupied Goajiro country) and in Taino (nu\u00e7ay or nozay [nos\u00e1i] \"gold\" in Ciboney \u2014 cf.

Jolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with the Cariban, Arutani, M\u00e1ku, and Sape language families due to contact within an earlier Guiana Highlands interaction sphere.

Hong was born in Chasong, North Pyongan. During his early life, he was a hunter who lived in Korea during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). In September 1907, Japan, as part of its colonial policies in Korea, passed a law that required hunters to turn in their hunting guns, with the intention of weakening the Korean resistance to the Japanese occupation. The law effectively crippled the ability of hunters to pursue their traditional livelihood, angering many hunters, including Hong. In response to the outlawing of hunters' guns, Hong organized a resistance force named the 1907 Righteous Army of Jeongmi. The Righteous Army carried out a number of battles against Japanese garrisons around the Bukcheong area, using hit-and-run attacks. When Japan annexed Korea in 1910, Hong moved to Manchuria, China to train anti-Japanese freedom fighters. After the March First Movement in 1919, Hong became a Commander-in-Chief of the Korean Independence Army. In August 1919, Hong crossed the Tumen River with 400 soldiers.Once across the river and in Korea, Hong successfully attacked the Japanese troops in Hyesanjin, Jaseong, and Kapsan. Hong and his soldiers would cross the Tumen River twice more, each time carrying out successful attacks against the occupying Japanese forces. In August 1919, Hong launched an advance operation into Korea. He succeeded in integrating the northern army in Gando with other forces. On May 28, 1920, Hong Beom-do's Korean Independence Army (Korean: \ub300\ud55c\ub3c5\ub9bd\uad70; Hanja: \u5927\u97d3\u7368\u7acb\u8ecd), Ahn-Mu's National Army (Korean: \uad6d\ubbfc\ud68c\uad70; Hanja: \u570b\u6c11\u6703\u8ecd) and Choi Jin-dong's Military Affairs Command (Korean: \uad70\ubb34\ub3c4\ub3c5\ubd80; Hanja: \u8ecd\u52d9\u90fd\u7763\u5e9c) were combined into the Korean Northern Army Command (Korean: \ub300\ud55c\ubd81\ub85c\ub3c5\uad70\ubd80; Hanja: \u5927\u97d3\u5317\u8def\u7763\u8ecd\u5e9c). They assembled troops and were prepared for a significant military operation. On June 4, 1920, troops of Korean Democratic Corps (Korean: \ub300\ud55c\uc2e0\ubbfc\ub2e8; Hanja: \u5927\u97d3\u65b0\u6c11\u5718) attacked Japanese Army units in Hamgyeongbuk-do Gangyang-dong (Korean: \uac15\uc591\ub3d9; Hanja: \u6c5f\u967d\u6d1e). The next day, a Japanese unit pursued the Independence Army, and the Korean Northern Army Command trapped the Japanese in Samdunja (Korean: \uc0bc\ub454\uc790; Hanja: \u4e09\u5c6f\u5b50), defeating hundreds of them. This encounter became known as the Battle of Samdunja (Korean: \uc0bc\ub454\uc790; Hanja: \u4e09\u5c6f\u5b50). On June 6 and 7, as the conflict increased, the Japanese Army deployed a battalion from the 19th Division, stationing it at Nanam (Korean: \ub098\ub0a8; Hanja: \u7f85\u5357). The Japanese battalion launched an attack on Bongo-dong (Korean: \ubd09\uc624\ub3d9; Hanja: \u9cf3\u68a7\u6d1e). The Independence Army combined forces were led by Hong Beom-do and hid in ambush in the mountains of Bongo-dong. As the Japanese forces advanced, the Korean militias ambushed the pursuing battalion from three sides, winning the battle. The Japanese battalion withdrew after suffering substantial casualties.An estimated 157 Japanese soldiers were killed and 300 wounded out of 500, and 13 Koreans were killed and 2 wounded out of 1,200~1,300. The conflict became known as the Battle of Bongo-dong, or the Battle of Fengwudong. It was the first large-scale battle between the Korean Independence Army and the Japanese Army in Manchuria. The Korean soldiers and the leadership of the Korean Northern Army Command were inspired by the victory, as were Koreans in China and Korea. The Korean resistance forces served as momentum for further independence battles in the 1920s. In October of the same year, working together with Kim Jwa-jin, Hong again carried out an attack against Japanese troops at what is known as the Battle of Cheongsanri (Korean: \u9752\u5c71\u91cc; Hanja: \uccad\uc0b0\ub9ac). The Japanese Army, having lost the battle in Cheongsang-ri and other locations, retaliated by carrying out a campaign of brutal scorched earth warfare that included the killing of Koreans and burning of villages. In response, the Korean Independence Army launched a military counter offensive. In December 1920, Hong'sforces were integrated with other independence forces to organize the Korean Independence Corps. In 1921, Hong and his forces sought refuge in the Soviet Union from the Japanese forces. In June, the Soviet military enacted a policy by Joseph Stalin to secure Russian borders near China and Korea. Concerned that the Japanese Army might enter the Soviet Union in pursuit of Hong and other Korean independence fighters, the Soviet Union disarmed Korean troops. The loss of weapons and safe areas for Hong and his forces resulted in the collapse of the Korean Independence Army. Hong, still hoping to oppose the Japanese in Korea, chose to join the Red Army. In 1937, Stalin's deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union took place. Hong was among those 171,781 Koreans (almost the entire Soviet population of ethnic Koreans) forcibly relocated to Kazakhstan. Hong died in Kazakhstan in 1943. On October 25, 1963, Hong was posthumously awarded the Republic of Korea Medal of Merit for National Foundation. In August 2021, his remains were returned to Korea, ahead of an official state visit by Kazakh president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to South Korea.In 1919, Hong Beom-do (1868 ~ 1943) created relations with Koreans residing in Yeonggae, Primorsky Krai, and Gando (Jiandao). In March 1920, he joined forces with the Korean National Association Army, led by An Mu, and they became an autonomous organization of Korean resistance fighters opposed to Japanese colonialism. During this time they lived and operated in the area of Nosuando. Starting with the attack on Hyesanjin (a city located on the Yalu River) in August 1919, the military forces led by Hong launched a military campaign against the Japanese forces in northern Korea. After March 1920, Hong led the coalition of the Korean independence forces in the northern area of Manchuria. Hong Beom-do, who had also led the Korean Righteous Army, has won several victories since 1907 at Gaksan, Samsu, and Bukcheong. These successes eventually led to increased attacks by the Japanese Army and the Korean army's activities in Korea became difficult, resulting in a need to escape in 1910 to Primorsky and Kando. Once in a safer location inside Russia, Hong continued his campaign against the Japanese. In August 1918, when Japan invaded Primorsky in support of the White Army during the Russian civil war, Hong Beom-do formed a military force centered around the former independence army and Korean people living in Manchuria. When the March 1st Movement took place in 1919, Hong and his soldiers moved to Antuhyun. Later, in August 1919, the Korean independence army crossed the Yalu River and wiped out a Japanese military unit. This was the first domestic military operation to take place in Korea following the March 1st Movement. In October, Hong's forces once again moved into Korea, occupied Ganggye and Manpojin, fighting a fierce battle with the Japanese army in Jaseong county, northern Korea. By March 1920, Hong was allied with the Dongdo-dong Military Service, led by Choi Jin-dong, who had been stationed in Hoeryong and Jongseong (Wongseong) along the Tuman coast of the Tuman River.The domestic resistance operation of the Korean independence forces provided a boost to the national spirit of Koreans everywhere and prompted further armed resistance struggles in Manchuria. By March 1920, the Korean independence army had moved its base from Antuhyun to Wang Qinghyun, China and received financial support from the Korean People's Association for a larger domestic resistance operation. Hong also joined forces with the National Liberation Army, which was under the leadership of the Korean People's Association. The military's finances and administration were managed by the Korean Minjok Association and the Korean Independence Army was directed by Hong Beom-do. On May 3, 1920, the Korea Military Association held a joint military operation with other Korean military and resistance forces in Wangchunhyeon Poomdong. Also locatedthere were the Provisional Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Korean Civil Corps. The northern Korean military group orchestrated many of the subsequent activities, specifically being in charge of administration, politics, and finances. Hong Beom-do became the head of the Korean Northern Army Command and was in charge of the military forces. The Korean rebels were assembled into four groups under the leadership of Yi Cheon-oh, Kang Sang-mo, Kang Si-beom, and Jo Kwon-dong. On June 4, 1920, the Independence Army of Korea, which was led by Park Seung-gil, entered Jaseong County, Korea and ambushed Samdungja and attacked a Japanese army patrol. In retaliation, the Japanese army occupied Nanam-dong (now Cheongjin) in North Hamgyeong-do of the Japanese 19th Division headquarter base. By June 7, the Daehan Independence Army, National Association Army, Doron Ministry of Military, and the Shinmin Corps had defeated the battalion of 19th Division of the Japanese Army in Bong-o-dong and won the great victory. On July 8, Hong and his forces surprised and defeated the Japanese police who were searching for the independence forces in that area.<PIC>", "images": ["w_s1232"], "tokens": 2295}]}

It had four 230 m (750 ft) X-shaped antenna elements, which made it one of the largest spacecraft ever built. The Radio Astronomy Explorer B (RAE-B) mission was the second of a pair of RAE satellites. It was placed into lunar orbit to provide radio astronomical measurements of the planets, the Sun, and the galaxy over the frequency range of 25-kHz to 13.1-MHz. The experiment complement consisted of two Ryle-Vonberg radiometers (nine channels each), three swept-frequency burst receivers (32 channels each), and an impedance probe for calibration. The experiment antenna package, made of BeCu, consisted of very long travelling wave antennas forming an X configuration: a 229 m (751 ft) upper V-antenna pointed away from the Moon; a 229 m (751 ft) lower V-antenna pointed toward the Moon; and a 37 m (121 ft) dipole antenna parallel to the lunar surface.There was also a 129 m (423 ft) boron libration damper boom system used to damp out any spacecraft oscillations about the equilibrium position. The spacecraft body, constructed of aluminum and aluminum honeycomb, had a mass of 328 kg (723 lb) at launch and 200 kg (440 lb) in lunar orbit. It was a truncated cylinder 92 cm (36 in) in diameter and approximately 79 cm (31 in) high, with four fixed solar paddles. The solar arrays were n-p solar cells generating 25 watts and powering nickel-cadmium batteries. The maneuvering system consisted of a hydrazine velocity correction package, a cold gas attitude control system, and a solid fuel lunar insertion motor. Data were returned to the Earth via either a low power UHF/(400-MHz) transmitter, in real time, or stored in an onboard tape recorder and transmitted to Earth via a high power Ultra high frequency (UHF) transmitter (400-MHz). Two tape recorders provided backup storage. A Very high frequency (VHF) transmitter served primarily for range and range-rate measurements and as a backup. Commands were received on a VHF (148-MHz) receiver, which also was a part of the range and range-rate system. Spacecraft attitude was determined by: (1) a solar aspect system, (2) a horizon sensor system and (3) a panoramic attitude sensor system, and was accurate to 1\u00b0. The spacecraft was gravity gradient oriented (Z axis parallel to local vertical). Explorer 49 was launched after the termination of the Apollo program in 1972, and although it did not examine the Moon directly, it became the last American lunar orbital mission until the launch of Clementine spacecraft in 1994. It was launched on 10 June 1973, at 14:13:00 UTC from Cape Canaveral by the Delta 1913 from the launch site LC-17B. Explorer 49 was placed into lunar orbit so that radio waves from Earth would not be as big of an interference as Explorer 38 had discovered. After launch on a direct ascent trajectory to the Moon and one mid-course correction on 11 June 1973, was placed into lunar orbit on 15 June 1973, at 07:21 UTC, after a 20 seconds firing of the solid apogee kick motor, and began operations on 20 June 1973.Initially only the 37 m (121 ft) dipole antenna was deployed, during which the spacecraft was operated in a 4-rpm spin-stabilized mode with the spin axis in the ecliptic plane normal to the spacecraft-Sun line. After three weeks the dipole booms were retracted, the spacecraft reoriented, the long-V antennas and libration damper were extended, and the dipole was redeployed. The lower V-antenna was initially extended to 183 m (600 ft) during the first 16 months of flight and was extended to its full 229 m (751 ft) length in November 1974. The lunar orbit and position of the Earth as a radio source imposed periodicities on the observations of 29.5 days (the lunar synodic month) and 24.8 hours (the interval between consecutive sweeps of a given Earth geographic position past the Moon.<PIC> The principal investigator for all the eg this time, eight coarse and two fine samples were taken. Of the eight coarse samples, the first was not reliable since not enough time had elapsed for the receiver to stabilize after the frequency switch was made.

It can be viewed as an intramolecular redox reaction, as one carbon center is oxidized while the other is reduced. The reaction has been shown to work in aromatic, semi-aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic substrates. The reaction works best when the ketone functional groups have no adjacent enolizable protons, as this allows aldol condensation to compete.

Born in lower Manhattan, New York on July 21, 1904, he was the son of French immigrants, Meyer was raised in Los Angeles, where he began automobile racing at various California tracks. Early in his career, he helped prepare the Miller driven by Frank Elliott in 1926, destroking the engine to bring it within the 91+1\u20442 cu in (1,499 cc) displacement limit permitted by the rules. Meyer went with the car when it was sold in 1927 to Fred Holliday (of Holliday Steel Company) as the Jynx Special (a morbidly ironic name, since Jimmy Murphy had been killed in it in 1924). He would be mechanic for Wilbur Shaw in the Indianapolis 500 that year. Meyer also served as co-driver, taking the car from seventh place up to sixth. In 1928, Phil Shafer's intended Miller entry went up for sale, and Alden Sampson bought the car for Meyer. Meyer passed the rookie test, qualified thirteenth, and took the lead on Lap 181; he won by a margin of 25 seconds, at an average speed of 99.5 mph (160.1 km/h).The same year, Meyer won a 200 mi (320 km) event at the 1+1\u20442 mi (2.4 km) board track at Altoona, Pennsylvania, at an average speed of 117.02 mph (188.33 km/h), in a Stutz-Miller. He earned consistent points finishes to make him AAA's National Champion. He would claim the title again in 1929 and 1933. At the 1929 Indianapolis 500, Ray Keech beat Meyer, only to be killed at Altoona two weeks later, the season's second 200 mi (320 km) event there, which Meyer won, averaging 110 mph (180 km/h). Meyer managed only fourth place at the 1930 Indianapolis 500, and the Great Depression curtailed racing. That, plus the closure of many board tracks as unsafe, led Meyer to concentrate more on dirt track racing. In 1933's 500, at the wheel of the Tydol Special Miller, Meyer took the lead on Lap 129. Meyer steadily increased his lead from there, until he was fully four laps up on the field by the checkered flag. Despite lifting later in the race, Meyer's race average, 104.16 mph (167.63 km/h), was still a record. By winning his second 500, he joined a fairly exclusive club. Meyer started the tradition of drinking milk (buttermilk at the time) in victory lane that year, when he drank a glass. Following his 1936 victory, he drank from a glass milk bottle instead, as most race winners have done since. Meyer followed his success in 1935, forming Champion Drivers, Inc., to promote racing, along with nine other top racers. He had a successful 1936 season, winning at Altoona, placing second at the difficult Ascot track, and winning his third Indianapolis 500 (in the Ring Free Special Miller, at an average speed of 109.1 mph (175.6 km/h). Following the suggestion of former race winner, Tommy Milton, that year he became the first driver to receive the Pace Car as part of the race winnings. Meyer came close to winning a (then-record) fourth 500 in 1939, in the Bowes Seal Fast Special Miller. Battling Shaw with just four laps to go, Meyer lost control and spun; while unhurt, Meyer's race was lost.He sold the Miller to Rex Mays the next year, going back to becoming a mechanic\u2014or, rather an engine builder: he went into partnership with Dale Drake, taking over Offenhauser's engine plant. Meyer-Drake Offys would dominate Indy for most of the next two decades, powering every winner until 1968. Meyer joined Ford in 1964, and through worked on development of the Ford V8, which powered four 500 winners in that time. Meyer's wife June did not even know he was racing in the 1928 Indianapolis 500. Earlier in the day she was in Pennsylvania picking up a wrecked car and after that went to see her brother-in-law Eddie Meyer race in Reading. She found out about her husband's victory after the track announcer in Reading asked the crowd to give a big hand to Eddie Meyer, the brother of the Indianapolis 500 winner. Meyer died on November 7, 1995 in Searchlight, Nevada, aged 91, where he had been living in retirement since 1972. He was interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.<PIC> Meyer's son Louis (Sonny) Meyer, Jr. assisted him in engine work at his race shops, and worked on the various DOHC Ford engines in USAC racing, including building 15 Indianapolis 500-winning engines. Grandson Louis III (Butch) built Oldsmobile Aurora engines for Team Menard in Indy Racing League IndyCar Series competition, winning the 1996-97 (18-month season) and 1999 championships before becoming the Indy Pro Series (now Indy Lights) director. Meyer's offspring continue to work in Indy racing. Louis Meyer III and his sons Louis (Michael) Meyer IV, and Matt Meyer are joint owners of Legacy Autosport with investors of the Metalloid Corporation, a team part of the Road to Indy..

He made his first-team debut on 1 April in a 3\u20132 defeat at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Championship, coming on as a 78th-minute substitute for Mitch Hancox. According to the Birmingham Mail's match report, \"he was nimble, showed the odd glimpse\". He made his second and last appearance of the season, also as a late substitute, in Birmingham's next match. At the end-of-season awards ceremony, Arthur was honoured as Academy Player of the Season. He made his first competitive start on 6 August 2013, as Birmingham beat Plymouth Argyle 3\u20132 after extra time in the first round of the League Cup, and his first league appearance of the season a few days later, as a second-half substitute in a home defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion.On 21 March 2014, Arthur became the third Birmingham youngster, after Charlee Adams and Nick Townsend, to join Conference Premier club Lincoln City on a youth loan until the end of the season. He went straight into the starting eleven for the following day's match at Gateshead, but was replaced at half-time with his side two goals behind. He made five more appearances before returning to Birmingham. Arthur joined League Two side Cheltenham Town on 25 July 2014 on a six-month youth loan. On his second appearance, he scored his first senior goal: in the 84th minute, he latched on to a long goalkeeping clearance and \"showed his strength to hold off Jordan Mustoe and bundle it past Simpson into the net\" to put Cheltenham 2\u20131 up, which proved to be a winning lead after Accrington Stanley's Kal Naismith missed a late penalty. He scored again a week later as Cheltenham came back from 2\u20130 down to win at Tranmere Rovers, and further enhanced his \"super-sub\" reputation with a 90th-minute header in the next match to secure a 1\u20130 win against Hartlepool United that took Cheltenham top of the table. Given his first start in the Football League Trophy, he scored Cheltenham's second goal, again with a header, to ensure their progress to the second round at Oxford United's expense. He made his first league start on 13 September, in a 1\u20130 defeat away to Luton Town, and was recalled by Birmingham the following day. A hamstring injury prevented any immediate involvement with the team, but after what assistant manager Steve Watson described as a breathtaking training session, and with Demarai Gray unavailable through injury, Arthur made his full League debut for Birmingham on 30 September 2014 in a 3\u20131 win at Millwall, the club's first away win of the season. He missed out on a debut goal in the next match, away to Charlton Athletic, when his attempt was disallowed for offside against Clayton Donaldson.After Gary Rowett took over as manager, Arthur had a brief run in the side, and was given a new two-year contract at the end of the 2014\u201315 season, but he never broke through to the first team; his last league appearance for the club came on 6 December 2014, in a 1\u20130 defeat away to Blackpool. Arthur returned to Cheltenham Town on 19 August 2016 on loan until 2 January 2017. His progress was disrupted by injury, and he returned to Birmingham having made just seven appearances. He was released when his contract expired at the end of the season.<PIC> After trials with National League clubs Solihull Moors and Macclesfield Town, Arthur signed a one-year contract with Macclesfield on 1 August 2017. He linked up again with assistant manager Steve Watson, his former coach at Birmingham. Arthur made his debut as a late substitute in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Hartlepool United on 8 August. He made 14 league appearances and scored once, in a 4\u20131 defeat at home to Maidstone United, as Macclesfield went on to win thOn 15 April 2022, Arthur scored his fifth goal of the season which proved to be the winner as Dover got only their second win of the season against Boreham Wood, taking their points tally up to zero after their twelve-point deduction prior to the season. Arthur was not retained by the club following relegation. On 28 May 2022, Arthur joined National League club Maidenhead United.

The band formed in late 2014 and relocated to Melbourne, Victoria in April 2015. They subsequently released their debut EP Fade in May 2017. After numerous lineup changes, Windwaker solidified their lineup in 2018 before the release of their single \"New Infinite\". In March 2019, Windwaker released their self-produced sophomore EP Empire, and made their second festival appearance 11 days before the release at Download Festival Melbourne. Windwaker, named after the Legend of Zelda game of the same name, was formed in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. The founding lineup featured vocalist Will King, bassist Indey Salvestro, drummer Chris Lalic and guitarists Mark Mcghie and Will Eggleton. In April 2015, Windwaker moved to Melbourne, Victoria and began performing and recording new material. Their debut single \"The Charade\", featuring Zach Britt of Dream On, Dreamer, was released on September 15 2015. Windwaker's next single \"Castaway\" was released on November 2, 2016, and was later included on their debut EP.The band began performing with Liam Guinane, who unofficially acted as both a live and studio guitarist after the departure of Mcghie, while guitarist Chris Moohan began playing with the group after the departure of Eggleton. Windwaker's debut EP Fade was released on May 31, 2017. The EP was produced, mixed and mastered by Sonny Truelove at STL Studios in Sydney, Australia. On January 15, 2018, Windwaker introduced guitarist Jesse Crofts as an official member. Two days later, Guinane was officially introduced as the fifth member of the band. On April 2, the band released the single \"New Infinite\", the first track to feature Guinane and Crofts. The band made their first festival appearance at BIGSOUND Festival in Brisbane, Queensland in September. In early 2019, the hashtag #TheSitch frequently began to appear across social media forums in Australia. On February 1, 2019, Windwaker released the single \"The Sitch\" with an accompanying music video and announced pre-orders for their sophomore EP Empire. The band released the second single of the release, \"My Empire\", on March 5 with an accompanying music video. The self-produced EP was mixed, mastered and engineered by drummer Chris Lalic, while additional engineering was provided by guitarist Liam Guinane and Declan White. Vocalist Will King commented about the release: \"Coming out of our last record, a record deeply rooted in post-adolescent feelings of pain and loneliness, as a band, it\u2019s safe to say that we all had this strong desire to redeem ourselves of those sole qualities. I think we have always feared trapping ourselves in a box, kept in by one-dimensional expectations, and we are very conscious of not allowing that influence to hinder our creativity. We are absolutely not a band who is going to sit around all day writing the same songs over and over again.\" Eleven days before the release of the Empire EP, Windwaker played their first large festival at Download Festival Melbourne, after winning a national triple j Unearthed competition. Empire was released on March 22, with a limited physical release following in June. All of the shows for the Empire tour sold out. The band subsequently signed with New World Artists for bookings.In July Windwaker joined Beartooth on their Disease Tour as support, alongside Thornhill. Windwaker announced that Guinane was unable to attend the tour due to personal obligations, so Weighbridge guitarist Sean Ross filled in. They also stated their plan to cover Silverchair's hit \"Freak\" on the tour. On September 9, Guinane announced he would be leaving Windwaker to focus on his other band Reside.

The Antigua and Barbuda Cricket Association is a member of the Leeward Islands Cricket Association, which itself is a member association of the West Indies Cricket Board, and players from Antigua and Barbuda generally represent the Leeward Islands cricket team at domestic level and the West Indies at international level. The team made its List A debut at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, and its Twenty20 debut at the 2006 Stanford 20/20 tournament. As of 2015, the team has played 14 List A matches and four Twenty20 matches. The team captain is Sylvester Joseph, while Ridley Jacobs is the team coach. In the mid-1890s, several touring English amateur sides played matches against Antiguan representative sides. R. S. Lucas' XI toured in 1895, winning by an innings and 69 runs, and A. A. Priestley's and Lord Hawke's XIs both toured in early 1897, winning by an innings and 96 runs and 259 runs, respectively.Part of the colony of the British Leeward Islands until 1958, and a member of the West Indies Federation between 1958 and 1962, Antigua played almost exclusively in the Leewards Islands Tournament, with occasional matches against touring teams, which included a \"New Zealand Ambassadors\" team in 1970, Kent in 1973 and 1979, and Canada in 1976. At West Indian domestic level, Antiguan and Barbudan cricketers represented the Leeward Islands cricket team, which debuted in the Shell Shield, the domestic first-class competition, in 1958. The Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands participated together as the Combined Islands cricket team from 1965 to 1981, when they separated again. Antigua and Barbuda gained independence in 1981, and from then on participated as \"Antigua and Barbuda\". The team toured Bermuda in September 1984, drawing a three-day match with the Bermuda national team. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Antigua and Barbuda fielded a separate team at the cricket tournament, as did Jamaica and Barbados. Matches at the tournament had List A status. Antigua and Barbuda were drawn in Group B, along with Australia, Canada, and India. The team's first match, against India at the Tenaga National Sports Complex, finished in a no-result due to rain. The team was captained by Dave Joseph, and included seven West Indies international players: Curtly Ambrose, Eldine Baptiste, Kenny Benjamin, Winston Benjamin, Ridley Jacobs, Sylvester Joseph, and Richie Richardson. After losing to Australia and defeating Canada, Antigua and Barbuda finished second in Group B over India due to a higher net run rate, but did not qualify for the semi-finals. The team's leading run-scorer at the games was Ridley Jacobs, who scored 74 runs, and the leading wicket-taker was Anthony Lake. As part of a reorganisation of the structure of cricket in the West Indies, Antigua and Barbuda, along with the other Leeward and Windward Islands constituent members, fielded teams at the Red Stripe Bowl, the domestic one-day tournament, in the 2001\u201302, 2002\u201303, and 2003\u201304 seasons. The team was largely unsuccessful, and did not progress beyond the group stage.Antigua and Barbuda also participated in the Stanford 20/20 tournament in 2006 and 2008, being knocked out in the quarter-finals in both instances. The team played a number of matches against touring sides in the mid-2000s, including against England, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, and India cricket team.

He held the British and Commonwealth heavyweight title from 1958 to 1959, and twice challenged for the world heavyweight title, losing to Floyd Patterson in 1959 and Muhammad Ali in 1966, both times via knockout. He was one of a quartet of British boxers, with Henry Cooper, Joe Erskine, and Dick Richardson, who dominated the British boxing scene throughout the 1950s and 1960s. An orthodox fighter, London was 6 feet tall and fought at about 14 stone 12 pounds (208 lbs). His nicknames in the ring were \"The British Bulldog\" and \"The Blackpool Rock\". London was born in West Hartlepool, County Durham, on 19 June 1934. He moved to Blackpool when he was 16 years old, where he resided into his later years. His father, Jack London, beat Freddie Mills in 1944 to win the British heavyweight title. He also had a brother, Jack junior, who fought as a light-heavyweight. His father fought under the name \"London\" rather than Harper, as a homage to an American novelist with this name.Brian never liked the idea of boxing as a child, as he didn't like the idea of having cauliflower ears like his father and his associates. London was spurred to take up boxing during his time in the Royal Air Force for national service, after an officer learned of his familial relations. It wasn't so much of a choice, but rather the expectations of his colleagues. He fought as an amateur before turning professional in 1955. London made a good start to his career, winning his first twelve bouts, one of which was against RAF light heavyweight boxer Brian Wiltshire (UK) in 1951. He finally lost when he came up against Henry Cooper in May 1956. Cooper stopped him with a technical knockout in the first round. Following this defeat, London continued his winning run, apart from two ten-round points defeats, against Heinz Neuhaus in Dortmund, in 1957 and against the talented American Willie Pastrano in February 1958. In June 1958, London fought Joe Erskine, the Welsh boxer, for the British and Commonwealth heavyweight titles. The fight was at the White City Stadium, London, and London took the titles with an eighth-round knockout. He followed this in September with a revenge win against Willie Pastrano, by a technical knockout in the fifth round. On 12 January 1959, London lost his titles in a fight against Henry Cooper, losing for the second time to the Londoner by a points decision after fifteen rounds. In May 1959 he was given the chance of a world title fight against current champion Floyd Patterson, but he lost the bout in Indianapolis by a knockout in the eleventh. He also lost to the Cuban Nino Valdez later that year, by a technical knockout in the seventh. However, in January 1960, London bounced back when he beat the American Pete Rademacher by a knockout in the seventh. London challenged Dick Richardson in August 1960 for his European heavyweight title, but lost the bout in Porthcawl, Wales on a technical knockout in the eighth.This result provoked a brawl, when London's father and brother invaded the ring to protest that Richardson had used his head to open a cut on his opponent. When Richardson's trainer shouted a few remarks at London, London replied with an impressive combination of blows, decking him, and chaos broke out. As a result of the incident, London was fined by the British Boxing Board of Control. London lost to American Eddie Machen in October 1961 by a technical knockout in the tenth, and in April 1963, he lost to Ingemar Johansson of Sweden on points over twelve rounds. London then fought Henry Cooper for the third time in February 1964, when he challenged for his British and Commonwealth titles, as well as the vacant European title. The fight took place in Manchester, and Cooper won on points after fifteen rounds. His next fight of note was in March 1965, against the young \"Golden Boy\" of British boxing, Billy Walker. London won on points after ten rounds. On 6 August 1966 London fought for the World Heavyweight Championship for the second time at the age of 32, when Muhammad Ali came to defend his title at Earl's Court Exhibition Hall in England. Ali at 24 years old with the advantages of height, weight, reach, speed and youth on his side, put on a masterful performance against a clearly out-classed opponent, almost hitting London at will as the fight went on. As London put it in an interview with the BBC: \"he was just getting through all the time\". Ali bouncingly circled continually, whilst London tracked doggedly after him for the first two rounds seemingly with a strategy of trying to land a single knock-out punch to the American champion. London succeeded in landing only one blow in the match, a left jab to Ali's jaw midway through the first round which caught Ali by surprise and left him for a moment stunned (and wide-open for a follow through right cross, which London failed to take advantage of), but the blow lacked weight and Ali was able to quickly recover. On coming out for the 3rd Round London hesitated to engage.Ali danced him into a corner and threw a rapid 12-punch combination in three seconds, with the tenth knocking London down and ending the fight. In a post-career media interview, London described Ali as: Big, fast and he could punch, whereas I was smaller, fatter and couldn't punch. He stopped me in three rounds and that was it, I don't think I hit him. It was good money and I got well paid for it \u2013 that's all I fought for. Every fight I ever had I always had a go, but with Muhammad Ali I thought \"don't get hurt Brian\", and I therefore didn't try, which was wrong, totally wrong.<PIC> In March 1967, London next fought American, Jerry Quarry, in Los Angeles, losing the fight by a unanimous decision after ten rounds. In November 1967, London had what was to be the last win in his career when he fought the talented American Zora Folledon on many occasions and thought it would be nice to look him up. I suppose we all realised at the time that we were leaving ourselves vulnerable\". Like many other boxers, London continued fighting long after his prime. He was 22 wins to 3 losses early in his career but lost 17 of his last 33 fights. In judging London's career it should be remembered that he fought some of the best fighters in the world, including four who at some stage were world champions \u2013 Ali, Patterson, Johansson and Pastrano. My dad was Jack London and I was expected to fight as well. I was never a great fighter. I was just really, really fit. \u2014 Brian London The British Boxing website listed London at number eight in a list of the top ten post World War II British heavyweight boxers in 2004. He had a dark sense of humour, and when asked if he would have done anything differently with Muhammad Ali, he replied, \"Yeah, I should have shot him\". He died on 23 June 2021 at the age of 87. He had suffered a long illness prior to his death. ", "images": ["w_s1277"], "tokens": 1684}]}

Greenwood was born in York, North Yorkshire and grew up in the village of Copmanthorpe. He attended Copmanthorpe primary school and then went on to Tadcaster Grammar School. Greenwood was playing for Copmanthorpe when he joined York City's Centre of Excellence. He soon joined the under-11s and was coached by City's Colin Sanderson and then progressed into the under-12s, where he was coached by John Stockton and Garry Naylor. He spent two years with York City in total and also played regularly for Copmanthorpe and for York School Boys. At only 12 years of age, Greenwood was contacted by Nottingham Forest and was asked to join them for a two-week trial period. Greenwood was set to travel to Nottingham, when out of the blue, he received a call from Manchester United urging him to join them instead. Although Greenwood's father is a Leeds United fan and disliked the prospect of his son joining Manchester United, he put all sense of rivalry behind him and recognised his son could not miss out on this opportunity.He joined the Manchester United under-13s side as a right-back and occasional centre-back and played in the same team as Chris Eagles and Phil Picken, as well as training with older players such as Kieran Richardson. His coach at the time was Paul McGuinness, the son of former York manager and Manchester United player, Wilf McGuinness and Greenwood would regularly train at Manchester United's Carrington training ground where he would see many of the first team players preparing for Premier League games. Greenwood was not accepted on Manchester United's youth trainee programme and was released by the club. However, soon after Greenwood received offers from 23 clubs including Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers. Yorkshire club Sheffield Wednesday was the most persistent and Greenwood felt this was the right move for him. He was signed by academy director, Jimmy Shoulder and the first team manager at the time was Terry Yorath. Greenwood had to wait until Wednesday 22 September 2004 for his first professional start. He played at right-back in a League Cup 1\u20130 defeat to Coventry City who were a division above Wednesday. Assistant manager Mark Smith singled him out for praise for dealing with opponents who were recently in the Premier League. After this impressive start, Greenwood only made two more substitute appearances before being deemed not good enough by new manager Paul Sturrock. He then moved to Stockport County on 15 July 2005 for the 2005\u201306 season, appearing for the club 25 (22 times in the league), while with the club he played in defence although he is normally a midfield player. A move back to Yorkshire and his hometown came 17 July 2006 as he was signed by Conference National side York City. Greenwood was offered a new contract by York at the end of the 2006\u201307 season on 16 May 2007.<PIC> He joined Gainsborough Trinity on loan in January 2008.

It was established as a district in 1988 comprising two former administrative units of Zhob District: the Upper Zhob sub-division and the sub-tehsil of Badinai, previously named Kashatoo and part of the subdistrict of Kakar Khurasan. Early in the 13th century the country came within the sphere of the raids organised by Genghis Khan, the Mongol. In 1398 AD, an expedition against the Afghans of the area was led by Pir Muhammad, grandson of Amir Timur. Although no authentic information exist about any foreign occupation, many forts, mounds and karezes are attributed to the Mughals. Both Nadir Shah (reigned 1736\u201347) and Ahmed Shah (reigned 1747\u201373) extended their power through Balochistan and thenceforth Zhob remained under the more or less nominal suzerainty of the Durranis and Barakzais until it came under British protection.In the middle of the 18th century Ahmed Shah granted a sanad (certificate) to Bekar Nika, fourth in descent from Jogi and the head of the Jogezai family, conferring upon him the title and position of \"Badshah or Ruler of Zhob\". Shah Jehan Jogezai was conferred as Badshah of Zhob. The descendants of Shah Jehan Jogezai used to live in Loralai District of Balochistan. The British sent its Zhob Expedition in 1884 in order to occupy the Zhob region through Baratkhail. Meanwhile, the castles of Saifullah Khan Khoidadzai and Shah Jehan Jogezai (Badshah of Zhob) were demolished. On 7 October 1884, an assault on the Qalla (castle) of Shah Jehan near Akhterzai resulted the killings of many tribal people including Malik Hamza Daulatzai and Mohammad Ghous who fought bravely. All 500 tribal Sardars admitted their submission before the British forces and also signed an agreement that they will not interfere in the affairs of British Government in Zhob region except Saifullah Khan Khoidadzai and Shah Jehan Jogezai who had a narrow escape from the battle scene and established themselves at Kalat; where they used to operate their insurgency campaign against the British and never subdued before the British occupying forces. At the time of the 2017 census the district had a population of 342,932, of which 181,806 were males and 161,121 females. Rural population was 279,639 (81.54%) while the urban population was 63,293 (18.46%). The literacy rate was 32.77% - the male literacy rate was 43.22% while the female literacy rate was 21.00%. 432 people in the district were from religious minorities. Pashto was the predominant language, spoken by 97.85% of the population. The district is administratively subdivided into the following tehsils: Killa Saifullah Muslim Bagh At present the district is divided into two sub-divisions: Qilla Saifullah and Muslim Bagh. Kila Saifullah sub-division comprises one tehsil (Killa Saifullah) and one sub-tehsil (Badinai). Killa Saifullah tehsil is further sub-divided into two Qanungo circles and then into five patwar circles. The entire Badinai sub-tehsil is a Qanungo circle as well as patwar circle.Muslim Bagh sub-division comprises Muslim Bagh tehsil and Loiband sub-tehsil. The entire Muslim Bagh tehsil is one Qanungo circle, further sub-divided into four patwar circles. The Loiband sub-tehsil consists of one qanungo circle and is sub-divided into two patwar circles. Babu China Muslim Bagh Qilla Saifullah According to the Pakistan District Education Rankings 2017, district Killa Saifullah is ranked at number 127 out of the 141 ranked districts in Pakistan on the education score index. This index considers learning, gender parity and retention in the district. Literacy rate in 2014\u201315 of population 10 years and older in the district stands at 40% whereas for females it is only 6%. Post primary access is a major issue in the district with 88% schools being at primary level. Compare this with high schools which constitute only 4% of government schools in the district. This is also reflected in the enrolment figures for 2016\u201317 with 15,836 students enrolled in class 1 to 5 and only 338 students enrolled in class 9 and 10. Gender disparity is another issue in the district. Only 24% schools in the district are girls\u2019 schools. Access to education for girls is a major issue in the district and is also reflected in the low literacy rates for females. Moreover, the schools in the district lack basic facilities. According to Alif Ailaan district education rankings 2017, the district is ranked at number 140 out of the 155 districts of Pakistan for primary school infrastructure. At the middle school level, it is ranked at number 134 out of the 155 districts. These rankings take into account the basic facilities available in schools including drinking water, working toilet, availability of electricity, existence of a boundary wall and general building condition. Approximately 3 out of 4 schools do not have electricity in them. 2 out 3 schools lack a toilet and 1 out of 2 schools do not have a boundary wall. 2 out of 5 schools do not have clean drinking water. The main issue for the district is the poor infrastructure of schools. They are reported to be in poor condition and need immediate repair.The district is rich with mineral wealth and produces high quality chromite in Pakistan, the second largest reserve in the world. Gypsum, ores of coal, salt, granite, marble, copper and gabbro are also found in various parts of the district. Being rich in oil and gas, the government of Pakistan has started oil and gas exploration in the Murgha Fairzai, Shaighala and Kakar Khurasan areas. Killa Saifullah is about 182 km south of the provincial capital Quetta.

She often served as a flagship during her career and frequently served overseas. On one of these deployments, the ship received a radio message from Peking, one of the first long-range radio transmissions to a ship. Vettor Pisani participated in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 and the Italo-Turkish War of 1911\u201312, during which her admiral nearly caused a diplomatic incident with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During World War I, her activities were limited by the threat of Austro-Hungarian submarines and she was converted into a repair ship in 1916. Vettor Pisani was stricken from the Navy List in 1920 and scrapped later that year. Vettor Pisani had a length between perpendiculars of 99 meters (324 ft 10 in) and an overall length of 105.7 meters (346 ft 9 in). She had a beam of 18.04 meters (59 ft 2 in) and a draft of 7.2 meters (23 ft 7 in). The ship displaced 6,614 metric tons (6,510 long tons) at normal load, and 7,128 metric tons (7,015 long tons) at deep load.The Vettor Pisani-class ships had a complement of 28 officers and 472 to 476 enlisted men. The ship was powered by two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft. Steam for the engines was supplied by eight Scotch marine boilers. Designed for a maximum output of 13,000 indicated horsepower (9,700 kW) and a speed of 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph), Vettor Pisani only reached a speed of 18.6 knots (34.4 km/h; 21.4 mph) during her sea trials despite slightly exceeding her designed horsepower with 13,259 ihp (9,887 kW). She had a cruising radius of about 5,400 nautical miles (10,000 km; 6,200 mi) at a speed of 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). The main armament of the Vettor Pisani-class ships consisted of twelve quick-firing (QF) Cannone da 152/40 A Modello 1891 guns in single mounts. All of these guns were mounted on the broadside, eight on the upper deck and four at the corners of the central citadel in armored casemates. Single QF Cannone da 120/40 A Modello 1891 guns were mounted in the bow and stern and the remaining two 120 mm (4.7 in) guns were positioned on the main deck between the 152 mm (6.0 in) guns. For defense against torpedo boats, the ship carried fourteen QF 57 mm (2.2 in) Hotchkiss guns and eight QF 37 mm (1.5 in) Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also equipped with four 450 mm (17.7 in) torpedo tubes. Vettor Pisani was protected by an armored belt that was 15 cm (5.9 in) thick amidships and reduced to 11 cm (4.3 in) at the bow and stern. The upper strake of armor was also 15 cm thick and protected just the middle of the ship, up to the height of the upper deck. The curved armored deck was 3.7 cm thick. The conning tower armor was also 15 cm thick and each 15.2 cm gun was protected by a 5 cm (2.0 in) gun shield.Vettor Pisani, named after the eponymous Venetian admiral, was laid down on 7 December 1892 at the Royal Shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia. The ship was launched on 14 August 1895 and completed on 1 April 1899. She was the flagship of Rear Admiral Candiani, commander of the Cruising Squadron dispatched to China in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion. Vettor Pisani arrived there on 20 August and made port visits in Japan, Korea and Vladivostok before departing the area on 29 November 1901. She arrived at La Spezia in February 1902, but only remained in Italian waters for a year before departing for another year-long cruise to the Far East on 15 April 1903. On 14 October, the Italian Legation in Peking successfully radioed the ship off the coast of China, one of the first long-range radio transmissions to a ship. The cruiser arrived back in Italy on 13 June 1904. Nothing is known of her activities until May \u2013 June 1908 when Vettor Pisani made a short cruise in Greek waters. When the Italo-Turkish War of 1911\u201312 began on 29 September 1911, Vettor Pisani was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, Inspector of Torpedo Boats. His command, the Division of the Inspector of Torpedo Boats, was deployed in the Adriatic Sea and five of his destroyers encountered two Ottoman torpedo boats in the Ionian Sea only an hour after war was declared. One of the Ottoman ships was able to take shelter under the protection of the fortifications in Prevesa while the other was forced to beach itself with nine men killed by Italian gunfire. The Italians blockaded the port and the Duke requested permission to issue an ultimatum for the Ottoman authorities to surrender the ship lest he bombard the city with Vettor Pisani and the battleship Ammiraglio di Saint Bon. Protests in early October over Italian interference in Ottoman-controlled Albania by the Austro-Hungarian Empire forced the Italians to abandon operations there and permission was denied. The cruiser was based in Taranto and Brindisi for much of December. In mid-April 1912, the division escorted the 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisions of the Italian fleet from Taranto to the eastern Aegean Sea where it bombarded the fortifications defending the Dardanelles to little effect before the main body departed for Italy on the 19th.Several months later, Vettor Pisani supported an unsuccessful sortie by five torpedo boats into the Dardanelles in search of the Ottoman fleet on the night of 18/19 July. Obsolescent by the beginning of World War I, Vettor Pisani was not very active during the war. She spent the war in the Adriatic and participated in an abortive attempt in mid-1915 to bombard a rail line near Ragusa Vecchia on the Dalmatian coast. An Austro-Hungarian submarine, U-4, intercepted the Italian ships and sank the armored cruiser Giuseppe Garibaldi. The loss of Giuseppe Garibaldi and the sinking of the armored cruiser Amalfi by another submarine on 7 July severely restricted the activities of the other ships based at Venice. She subsequently became a repair ship in 1916 and was stricken from the Navy List on 2 January 1920. Vettor Pisani was sold for scrap and broken up beginning on 13 March.<PIC>", "images": ["w_s1298"], "tokens": 1627}]}
