A few days ago my sister showed me the Deceptive Desserts contest, and since I love baking and I had some new tools to try out, it gave me the perfect excuse and timing to start baking again!!I've always loved tales, but Alice's adventures in Wonderland has always had a special place on my heart since the day I discovered it. I don't know if it's because everything seems possible there, with talking and disappearing cats, an everlasting tea time, or the Hookah-Smoking Caterpillar, it just seemed like my dreamed fantasyland.So this cake may seem a regular cake....but it's not! As a tale, it tells a story... The queen of hearts has gone mad, and has started to cut everyone's head!! Off with their heads!!! Not even The Cheshire cat has escaped his madness, she killed everyone, and turned him into a cake! An insanely sweet and delicious cake, that bleeds to the axe's touch. So, if you like the cake and its creepy story, this is how I made it!! Step 1: Step 1: the Cheshire Cake.", "images": ["off-with-their-heads-cheshire-cake_0"], "origin_id": 40056}
{"chunk_id": "40056_2", "text": "<PIC> So, first things first; if we want the Cheshire cat cake, we should start making the batter!! It's a super sweet recipe, so if you are not a \"sugar fan\" you may wish to adjust the sugar amount this recipe has.Ingredients:- 300g all purpose flour- 6 egg whites (pasteurized or powder, but if you use powder you have tho restitute them first)- Vinegar or a pinch of cream of tartar- 400g white sugar or icing sugar, the one that you prefer.- 15 g (1 pack) of baking powder- Red/ pink food colouring- Blue/ Purple food colouring-OPTIONAL: flavouring of choice*you will also need a whisk, a couple medium sized bowls and a circular cake mold.For the preparation procedure:1. Preheat the oven at 180oC (Aprox. 360F) with fan.2. Start placing the egg whites and a little bit of vinegar/cream of tartar in a bowl, and with an an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, and whisk on a low speed for 1 minute, then increase th", "images": ["off-with-their-heads-cheshire-cake_1"], "origin_id": 40056}
{"chunk_id": "40056_3", "text": "e speed to medium and whisk until the egg whites form stiff peaks; the vinegar and cream of tartar help stabilizing the egg whites so if you don't want to add these to the recipe it's okay, but if you do, they will help a lot.3. When the mixture looks fluffy, start adding the sugar gradually, a tablespoon at a time, until the mixture gets stiff and glossy, like a mixture between the meringue consistency and royal icing consistency. If you have some flavouring, you will add it to the mixture now.4. In another bowl mix the flour with the baking powder, and once it's well blended, add a tablespoon at a time to the egg whites mixture, making sure there is still some remaining volume in the batter. Combine everything until the mixture is homogeneous.5. Divide the batter in half, and pour one half in the other bowl, because now it's time to add the colour. If you have pink and purple, just dye each bowl with one colour, and if you have red and blue, use a tiny bit of red for the \"pink batter\", and a mixture on red and blue to create the \"purple batter\".6.Prepare a circular cake mold, of about 25 cm diameter, with butter to make it \"non-adherent\". Now the fun part starts. Using a big spoon, start placing 1 spoon of the purple batter in the center of the mold; then, take one spoon of the pink batter and pour it OVER the purple one, also in the center of the cake mold, so the two colours look like 2 concentric circles. Repeat this procedure, spoon by spoon, until you finish with both bowls of cake batter. This will get you a zebra effect cake, which is supercool because it will simulate the stripes that the Cheshire cat has on its fur.7. Now it's time to put our cake into the oven!!! bake it at least for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, if it does not come out clean, add 10 minutes more until the cake is baked. I know that some ovens might be tricky with the baking time, so check it with the toothpick until it's perfectly cooked.8. Once the cake is out the oven, place it in a wire rack for 5 minutes; then run a knife around the edge of the pan and turn the cake out onto the racks to cool completely. Is very important that you let it cool completely.9. Once it's completely cold you can shape it; I decided to go with a flat domed cake, which is great for the final design, but you can totally trim any excess of cake until you get your desired shape. Step 2: Step 2: Filling and Icing the Cake. <PIC> Once the cake has cooled completely, we will fill it and cover it with buttercream. Since the cake is very colorful itself, I decided to make the buttercream pretty simple in terms of colour.Ingredients (Buttercream)-300g Butter at room temperature-200-300g icing sugar-Food colouring: blue-OPTIONAL: flavouring of choiceFor the preparation procedure:1. In large or medium bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until it gets light and fluffy. 2.Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar, a tablespoon at a time, until it reaches your desired hardness and it's fully incorporated. If you have a flavouring, you can add it now (better if it's in \"paste form\"). 3.", "images": ["off-with-their-heads-cheshire-cake_2"], "origin_id": 40056}
{"chunk_id": "40056_4", "text": "If the buttercream is too thick now to cover the cake, you can thin it adding 1 tablespoon of milk at a time into the mixture and combine until you get the desired consistency. 4.Once you get there, split the buttercream in half and dye one half with blue (until a teal blue is achieved), and let the other half with its natural colour. Put your buttercream into 2 disposable piping bags. Now we will start the filling and covering process.5. Cut the cake by half horizontally, so you will get the 2 layers of your cake. You can paint the inside of the cake with a little bit of jam (I did this just in the center of the cake)6. With the natural non-coloured buttercream, we will fill the cake, spreading the buttercream with a spatula until reaching our desired filling thickness, and then we will place the other layer of the cake on top.7. With this same buttercream, we will cover the cake completely, making sure all its surface has a layer or 2 of buttercream, to smooth all the edges. We will put it into the fridge for 15 minutes.8. Once the natural coloured buttercream is set, apply the blue tinted buttercream just on the sides of the cake. Put it back in the fridge for 10 minutes, and then apply a second layer on the sides and on the \"domed surface\", letting the flat top with the natural coloured buttercream (see photos).9. Place it in the fridge for 30 minutes Step 3: Step 3: Making the Flowers. <PIC> While the cake is in the fridge chilling, we will start making the flowers. If you have some leftover natural coloured buttercream from the previous step, you can use it now (take it out the piping bag first). If not, just use the previous recipe (step 2) and make some more; this buttercream will be more hard than the previous one, so keep that in mind.", "images": ["off-with-their-heads-cheshire-cake_3"], "origin_id": 40056}
{"chunk_id": "40056_5", "text": "I used the following food dyes to get the colour:- Purple- Pink- Green (darkg and light greeb buttercream)-Yellow-Orange- BlueThis procedure is very simple: Place a nozzle and fill 4 piping bags with the buttercream following this directions:- For the purple and blue flowers: \"paint\" the inside walls of the piping bag with purple buttercream; fill the rest of the piping bag with the blue buttercream; this will make more realistic flowers because they will be 2 toned.- For the purple and pink flowers: \"paint\" the inside walls of the piping bag with purple buttercream; fill the rest of the piping bag with the pink buttercream.- For the yellow and orange flowers: \"paint\" the inside walls of the piping bag with orange buttercream; fill the rest of the piping bag with the yellow buttercream.- For the green leafs: \"paint\" the inside walls of the piping bag with a dark green buttercream; fill the rest of the piping bag with the lightest green buttercream. We will keep this aside, since we will use it when we start assembling the cake.To make this flowers I used a set ofRussian Nozzles (PHOTO) that I bought a while ago, you can get them online easily. They make the procedure of making flowers super easy and quick: just put the nozzle in your bag as usually, fill it and squeeze like you would do with any other nozzle; because of the shape of this Russian nozzles, flowers are automatically made!!!1. Place a parchment paper on a flat surface and star piping the flowers; i find is better to make them separately and then place them on the cake one by one, it's cleaner and easier this way.2. Put them in the fridge to harden, at least 30 minutes. We will use this time to make our sculpting work. Step 4: Step 4: the Hookah-Smoking Caterpillar, the Heart Shaped Axe, Toadstools and the Cat's Tail. <PIC> We will now create our characters for the cake. For this we will use the following materials:- Cat tail: Pink and purple fondant- Toadstools: Red and white fondant- The Hookah-Smoking Caterpillar: Blue fondant (light and dark blue), white, black and pink fondant. For the Hookah we will need brown fondant, bronze and gold edible pigment.", "images": ["off-with-their-heads-cheshire-cake_4"], "origin_id": 40056}
{"chunk_id": "40056_6", "text": "- Heart shaped axe: Grey and brown fondant, and silver edible pigment.To assemble everything I used toothpicks but you can also use raw spaghetti or something similar. I also used some CMC in order to get the fondant hard faster.The Hookah-Smoking Caterpillar1. First of all, you should get a picture of the caterpillar that you will use as a guide. Once you have that, start making a cylinder with the dark blue fondant and another with the light blue fondant. Cut a section of 2,5 cm (about 1 inch) that we will use for the head. Start shaping the body, simulating the caterpillar body sections (making the edges rounded).2. With the pink fondant, make tiny fondant conic shapes that we will use to make it's legs (make 1 pair per section of the caterpillar body as shown in the photo). Attach them to the caterpillar body.3. Bend the caterpillar body, and hold that shape until the fondant hardens and dries. Now you have the body completed.4. With the 2,5cm section we cut before we will start shaping the head. For this we will start adding small pieces of dark blue fondant for the \"toupee\" and a small pice of light blue fondant for his cheeks and nose. With a sculpting tool we should shape them according to the guide picture, as well as it's mouth (see the pictures, I made my sister hold the head while I was taking the photo in order for you to see the final result).5. With the white and black fondant shape the eyes and glue them (with water) to the caterpillar head. Repeat the process with his brows (2 pointy black fondant cylinders). Once the head is done we will let it harden with the body.6. For its Hookah, roll 3 balls of brown fondant. Flatten 2 of them and shape the other one as a cone, and then glue them together. Roll a small piece of brown fondant as a small pointy cylinder, and shape like an \"S\"; attach it to the Hookah body, and paint it with the bronze edible pigment. Paint the top and the base of the Hookah with the gold pigment, and let it dry and harden.The Cheshire cat tail1. Roll 2 cylinders of purple and pink fondant.Cut them into tiny sections, and glue them alternatively: 1 pink, 1 purple, 1 pink,1 purple, saving the \"bigger sections for the end of the tail. Roll the assemblage into an homogeneous cylinder and let it dry a bit.The Toadstools1. Roll a white fondant cylinder; it has to be wide and short, with the top and the bottom flattened. This will be the toadstool \"foot\". Make 1 for each toadstool you will use in the cake.2. With red fondant roll a big ball and cut it in half to make the toadstool head. Smooth the edges of 1 half and let it start dry. Roll super tiny white fondant balls and glue them to the toadstool head. Repeat the process fore every toadstool you will want to make.3. Roll some more white fondant and flatten it until a 2mm width. Cut a circular piece and with a sculpting tool (photo) make some lines. This will go under the toadstool head, so once it's done, glue it to the red fondant piece we made earlier.4. Insert a toothpick into the toadstool\"foot\" and attach the head on the top, glue it with water for a better hold.The heart shaped axeSince the queen of hearts is the mad one, the axe had to be a heart shaped one as well.1. With grey fondant, we will make a layer of 3mm of width, and then we will cut a piece with the shape of a heart.2. With a rolling pin we will flatten the \"sharp\" edge of the axe, and we will paint this platened and thinned edge with silver edible pigment.3. Roll a cylinder of brown fondant, and place some toothpicks inside him to make it more stable. Make a small cut on the top edge, and place the heart shaped blade in it. Glue it with water, and with some more toothpicks give it some more stability. Let it dry and harden.

{"chunk_id": "40056_7", "text": "<PIC> This is the best part!! I had a lot of fun assembling this cake, it looked so colorful, like it just came out of wonderland!!So the assembling steps are the following (I used toothpicks to attach everything to the cake):1. Place the toadstools on the top-flat part of the cake. I made 2 of them, so, if you do this, put them together, since it represents that the Caterpillar head falls from the bigger toadstool to the smallest one.2. Attach the Cheshire cat tail to the side of the cake with a toothpick, and then bend it until it rests on the flat-top of the cake (see the photos as reference)3. Place the caterpillar body laying on its side on top of the tallest toadstool, and do the same with its head: place it laying on its side on the smallest toadstool.4. Place the Caterpillar Hookah on the biggest toadstool, next to the caterpillar body, and attach it with a toothpick and water.5. Now that we placed this figures, we will grab the blue buttercream we set aside before (the one that we used to cover the sides of the cake).We will decorate the sides of the cake with it and with a beautiful piping nozzle, makingsome filigrees or whatever comes to your mind.6. Now it's time to transfer our beautiful flowers!!! So we will take them out of the fridge, and with the help of a flat spatula we will remove them, one by one, from the parchment paper and we will place them on the \"domed/inclined\" part of the cake (see photos).7. With the green buttercream we set aside before, we will pipe some leaves (so we will use the correct piping nozzle). In order to get the best result, we will pie them between the flowers, at the bottom of the toadstools and around the cat tail. I attached a lot of photos so you can see how it looks reached this point. Step 6: Step 6: Blood and Final Touches. <PIC> Since the caterpillar's head has been cut, it should bleed, as well as the cake itself since we will stab it with our heart shaped axe. For this I used some melted sugar following this recipe:Ingredients:- 200g White sugar- 60ml water1. Place the sugar and the water in a small saucepan and stir it until all the sugar is disolved2. Wait until the heat makes the sugar and the water combine, and when it starts to get a golden colour, remove it from the heat.3.n the center if the cake. Now we will stab the cake with our heart shaped axe, so place it in the middle of the cake, pushing a bit, until it doesn't move; I did not use any toothpicks for this but if you have some difficulties attaching it to the cake, feel free to use them.7. Since the Cheshire cat is magical, its blood also is, so I sprinkled a little bit of edible glitter on the blood pool.8. Cut the cake and enjoy!!! :D (I attached a pic of how it looks inside *_** I made 2 diferent axes, but I changed the first one for the one that you see in the final pictures; the first one was too big, so its all about trial and error!And Now You are done!! Curioseur and curioseur, you have your cat cake made! I hope you liked this tutorial and feel free to ask if you have any doubts!

Commonly used in desserts like pies, crumbles and tarts, the Bramley apple is the most important cooking apple in England and Wales. The traditional 'Apple Pie' has been going since 1381! Eaten hot or cold, this classic British and popular dessert can be served with custard or ice-cream. If you have ever cooked with these dessert apples, you will know that preparing them are extremely simple and mostly cooked this way. You start off by peeling and coring the apple, followed by slicing them and adding lemon juice to stop them from browning. Finally, you add sugar. Depending on which recipe you make, I would add cinnamon to my apples for my Apple Pie. (Also raisins or sultanas would be included in this recipe however in our family we prefer without).Here is my take on this recipe. Simple, quick and ready to serve:You will need an apple pie dish tin, or a quiche tin will do.I like to cut 2 holes in the middle of my apple pie to let the steam come out, these apples cook really well in the oven and it's important you let them some air to cook! If you feel you have more dough left over, make some leaves or maybe a message on top as an additional take or maybe to impress someone!Bake in the oven at 200 degrees for 15 minutes, then 180 for 20 minutes. Rest for 5 minutes before serving. You can serve this with custard or anything you'd like. We sometimes use Greek yoghurt on the side, delicious! Also served cold is really lovely, maybe bring it along to a picnic in the park! Enjoy!", "images": ["old-english-apple-pie_0"], "origin_id": 40074}

And I have to say, even though it was time-consuming and confusing at first, it was well worth it. Many people never attempt it and I say \"You should!\" It's actually not quite as confusing as it seems and the final product is amazing. I was surprised I made some that looked exactly like the ones in the supermarkets. I used a recipe for laminated dough which makes this croissant has its many layers. The dough's concept is pretty much to layer butter and dough by folding and re-folding it. The butter melts when baked and created the many layers you see. After hours of rolling out the dough, the croissants are then shaped into its crescent form and ready to be baked. The baking process is also essential to croissants, especially if you have more than one tray going in. I made some pineapple jam to go with it and they tasted amazing. Definitely fluffy and the outside was perfectly crunchy. Now I didn't put the recipe up yet, so I decided to add some photos of these oh-so-amazing treats.

So let's begin.!SERVES : 1INGREDIENTS A glass of milk (approx. 200mL) 1/2 tsp Tea flakes 1 level tsp Coffee powder (Cappuchino will do great) 1 level tsp Cocoa powder (unsweetened) 2-3 tsps Sugar 1 tsp peel of butter (Optional )METHOD 1. Take 1/4th glass of the milk in a microwave safe glass and put the tea flakes in it. Microwave it at maximum until the milk starts to boil. 2. Take out the glass and mix with a spoon. 3. Filter the milk and tea flakes mixture into another glass. 4. Add the sugar, cocoa, coffee and beat it using a beater or a spoon. Beater should give a better foam. Continue to beat well until u get a nice thick foam. 5. Once done, add the remaining milk and butter and microwave it again for half a minute at maximum. 6.Beat again, just to ensure uniform flavor throughout. 7. Enjoy :)NOTES: Beating the surface will give a good immediate foam. Sugar can be adjusted according to your likes. You can opt for adding a bit heaped teaspoon of cocoa for a stronger flavor, but u will need to necessarily put 3 teaspoons of sugar, to avoid bitterness.HEALTH TIP: Avoid butter, and stick to only level teaspoon of cocoa.

Cream the butter in a countertop mixer with a dough attachment. (You can do this recipe by hand, but only if you\u2019ve got plenty of upper body strength. A handheld mixer will not be strong enough.) Beat in the brown sugar and eggs. Coat the inside of a measuring cup with nonstick spray or a little oil, then measure out the molasses and add it to the mixing bowl. The oil prevents the molasses from sticking excessively to the measuring cup. Add the water to the mixing bowl and beat. Gradually beat in the dry ingredients, stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides. The dough should be very stiff, almost like Play-doh. If it is still too soft and sticky, add another half cup of flour.Divide the gingerbread dough into 3 flattish patties, wrap them in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least an hour (up to two days). Step 4: Make the Gingerbread Pieces. <PIC> Preheat oven to 350 degrees and prepare cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. Roll out 1\u20444 inch thick on parchment paper or a pastry mat, dusting with flour as necessary to avoid sticking. A quarter inch is thicker than you might normally roll cookies, so use a ruler to check. Lay templates on dough and cut out with paring knife. Make sure to cut out the right number of copies of each piece. Unstick the pieces by sliding the paring knife underneath them. Use a spatula to transfer the pieces to the cookie sheets with a minimum of distortion. It is a good idea to segregate small pieces on different cookie sheets than large ones, because of the difference in baking times. Once the pieces are on the co", "images": ["how-to-make-a-gingerbread-tardis-with-doctor_4"], "origin_id": 40142}

Use any remaining dough to make anything you like\u2014gingerbread Daleks, K-9, or whatever. Place cookie sheets in preheated oven. Do not overload the oven with more than 2 cookie sheets, because this will cause uneven heating. Watch the pieces through the oven door. Cooking time varies widely from the small pieces to the large ones. Small pieces are done in as little as 6 minutes, while large pieces could take 20 minutes or more. Pieces are done when their edges and corners start to darken. Don\u2019t overcook\u2014you can always put an undercooked piece back in if you have to. With the pieces still on the warm cookie sheets, place the templates back on top of them one last time. Trim the warm gingerbread as needed\u2014once it cools, it will be too brittle. Once the pieces are solid enough, transfer them to a rack to finish cooling. Step 5: Make the \"Glue\" Icing.Recipe: 4 egg whites (Use 8 tablespoons of pasturized egg white product if you\u2019re worried about salmonella) 5 1/3 cups powdered sugar gel food colors Note: There is a small, but measurable, risk inherent in using raw egg whites if you plan to eat your Tardis. This risk is greater for young children, pregnant women, people with compromised immune systems, and the elderly. Even clean, unbroken eggs can be contaminated inside. If you\u2019re worried, you can buy pasturized egg whites in a carton, though these may not foam as well. Fill the large, shallow pan with 1-3 inches of water and put it on the stovetop on medium heat. Clean the metal mixing bowl so that there is no grease, oil, or fat inside. Put the egg whites in the metal mixing bowl, and put it in the pan of water as a double boiler. Whisk the egg whites constantly for several minutes until they are warm to the touch (if you\u2019re using a candy thermometer, 120-130 degrees Fahrenheit, no more). Remove the bowl from the heat, put it immediately into the mixer with the whisk attachment. Starting out slow, build up to high speed. Beat until whites form stiff peaks (when you pull the beaters out, the whites form sharp, somewhat droopy points like a Tim Burton landscape). Gradually beat in the sugar. Reserve about a quarter of the icing in a sealed container. Dye the rest dark blue with the gel coloring and put it in an icing bag with a piping tip, or in a ziplock bag with the corner cut off. Once this frosting dries, it is like plaster, but it is soluble in warm water. Step 6: Assemble Your Tardis. <PIC> Assemble your Tardis in a place where you can leave the pieces without fear that they will be disturbed by unauthorized personnel or pets. As I was making this project, the gingerbread Doctor had to regenerate twice, having twice suffered a horrible fate at the jaws of ravenous dogs. (On the plus side, eating gingerbread seems to improve a dog\u2019s breath.) Gather some heavy items\u2014like cookbooks or canned goods-- to prop up pieces while they set. You can also use masking tape to help hold pieces until they set.", "images": ["how-to-make-a-gingerbread-tardis-with-doctor_6"], "origin_id": 40142}
{"chunk_id": "40142_5", "text": "Look carefully at the plan view diagram to see how to join the pieces, or the Tardis won\u2019t be square. If you\u2019ve broken any pieces, glue them back together with icing. Assembly order: 1. back+1 side, roof pieces to each other 2. other side 3. base 4. roof 5. front left 6. top right 7. front right door (I left it slightly open) 8. frame edges 9. signs Glue the back to one of the sides first using the blue icing. Pipe a line along the edge and another line inside the angle of the join, like caulk. Don\u2019t worry too much if icing shows on the outside; that\u2019s why we dyed it blue. Prop the pieces up and leave them to set for at least an hour. While you\u2019re waiting, you can start on assembling the roof and decorating the Doctor. I used masking tape and a pop bottle lid to hold the roof pieces at an angle while they set. Once the back and first side have set, addthe second side and leave it to set again. These first few pieces will need the longest setting time. After these, the Tardis will have a little more stability and you can get away with working faster. If something is misplaced, it\u2019s better to find out before the glue has set all the way (3 hours, give or take). Next, glue the back and sides onto the base and glue the roof on. Stick the front left panel in place, making sure that there is space for the last pieces to fit in. Stick on the upper right panel, over the door opening. Put the door in at the angle you choose. Stick the upright frame edges in place (consult the plan diagram) and stick the top frame edges in place like lintels. Allow to set and stick the signs on. Step 7: Decorate Your Doctor. <PIC> Divide the reserved glue icing into small bowls for different colors, as many as you want for the doctor and his outfit. Remember to leave some white for decorating the Tardis if you haven\u2019t done that yet. Keep any icing you're not using sealed so it doesn't dry out. Use the gel colors to tint the icing.

You already have blue for his pants. I also iced a little piece of toothpick to make a sonic screwdriver for him to hold. The tip of a toothpick is useful for icing the details on the Doctor, too. Step 8: Turn Your Tardis Blue. You may choose to leave your Tardis a traditional gingerbread brown. If you want a blue Tardis, however, you will need to frost it because the molasses makes the gingerbread dough itself too dark to dye. This recipe is the kind of frosting you\u2019d get on a supermarket cake, chosen for spreadability, color, and shelf life, so don\u2019t expect it to taste as good as a buttercream. I chose to use frosting instead of the plasticky-smooth rolled fondant that is de rigueur for cakes these days, because the Tardis is wooden and slightly battered. Blue frosting for outside of Tardis: 1/3 cup vegetable shortening (Crisco) 1/8 teaspoon salt 2 cups powdered sugar (more or less) 2 tablespoons milk (more or less) Cream the shortening and beat in the salt. Beat in the milk and gradually add the sugar. If the consistency isn\u2019t how you like it for spreading, add more sugar or milk as necessary. Color with gel coloring. This frosting tends to darken slightly on the surface as it dries. Make sure the Tardis has securely set. To be safe, I let mine dry overnight before I frosted it. Frost the Tardis with a knife. If you are more of a perfectionist than I am, you can smooth it with a scrap of parchment paper as the frosting sets. Step 9: Add Decorative Details to the Tardis. <PIC> Pipe the windows on with white glue icing.I did this freehand, but if you are feeling very precise you can make the windows as squares on parchment paper and stick them onto the Tardis once they dry. Draw the square inset panels onto the Tardis freehand with the dark blue glue icing. Divide the window panes and write on the front sign with the dark blue icing, too. Spread dark blue as the background of the \u201cPolice Box\u201d signs. Write \u201cPolice Box\u201d on the signs in white. Glue the gumdrop on top. Step 10: Enjoy!.

Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to examine the practice of meditation and how you might incorporate it into your cooking. The act of cooking itself can be a form of meditation. I find that while I am preparing the ingredients for a dish or while I'm cooking it, my mind turns inwardly to self-reflection. This exercise in cooking and meditation can be a form of what is called walking meditation. Walking meditation involves being aware of your body's movements by redirecting any thoughts that may come up back to the movements of your body you are refocusing your mind and staying in the present.

{"chunk_id": "40183_4", "text": "<PIC> This is probably the most important part, since if you make a pigs-ear of this step, no amount of gilding can make your chocolates palatable to your loved one. And whilst it might be amusing to look on as she pretends that they're lovely, whilst simultaneously choking them down and repressing her gag reflex, it's probably not what you're trying to achieve with this endeavour.I know consumate cooks would never advocate the use of a microwave oven, and would always say to melt your chocolate on the stove inside a bowl suspended in boiling water. But we're blokes remember, and doing that is tantamount to wearing a big flowery apron. No, we're going to use the microwave. It was your best friend when you were single and you're not going to abandon it now that you're hitched.So here's what to do:1. Get 100-200 grams (i.e. a big bar) of chocolate and break it down into little cubes. Most chocolate will be formed into this anyway, so just break it up. Taste a little and put the rest in a microwavable bowl. Or, if you're me, the first bowl that comes out of the cupboard. Just make sure it's clean and free of meat sauce from last night's take away.2. Melt the chocolate in the microwave. Now - this is the bit where it can go wrong. You have to be really slow and patient doing this. You need to put the microwave on for about 10 seconds at a time, take the bowl out and stir the chocolate until it starts to leave traces on the bottom of the bowl. At the start, this won't appear to happen at all and the temptation is to stick it in for 30 seconds at a time. If you do this you'll mess your chocolate up and most likely start a small fire. 10 seconds at a time, take out, stir, put back in. That's the order of the day. You have to stir until as much choc melts as possible before putting it back in again. It should be the stirring that makes it melt, not sitting it in the microwave.3. Add any flavourings such as ginger oil or fresh vanilla pod or orange oil, or whatever she likes. One or two drops will do for about 200g of chocolate.Adding a load will stop your chocolate from setting, so be careful.4. Make sure you have your mold to hand once the chocolate has melted. It should stay melted for a few minutes and if it starts to harden can be melted gently as before.5. Carefully pour the choc into the mold.6. Let it cool naturally on the work surface for 15-30 minutes, but at this point it will still be very soft to the touch, so then you can put it into the fridge for about 15-30 minutes to make sure if goes hard. I observed that the higher the milkfat content in the chocolate then the longer it takes to harden and the easier it is to melt to the touch.Once it has set, you can remove it from the mold and begin to adorn it with your bling. Step 3: Gilding Your Chocs. <PIC> This is frankly, the most difficult bit, and when you look at the images, you'll see that I wasn't altogether successful ", "images": ["making-gold-amp-silver-leaf-chocolates_3"], "origin_id": 40183}

I mean, you won't know if you can apply gold leaf until you try - there's pretty much no other practical skill you can practise before this to make it any easier for you. It's an art-form in itself. Perhaps if you're good at soldering and have a steady hand then it'll help you. I'm crap at soldering too, so that probably why my applications look so bad.Gold leaf it thin. Very thin. It's not paper thin. It's air thin. So much so that if you open your gold leaf sheet and inhale sharply you might get a lungful. Seriously, it's nano-thickness and will attach to surfaces which come close to being in contact with it. It's a bit like cling flim, but cling won't disintegrate if you try to remove from your finger when it sticks. Gold and silver leaf will.However, being a practical bloke, you will use this to your advantage. At first, I wanted to completely coat an entire chocolate in gold. I was successful in doing this, but it looked wrong, and inedible.It looked even more wrong, when I did it with silver leaf, as it looked like it was still in the wrapping paper.So I decided to flake my leaf and apply it 'artistically'. Some might say unevenly and perhaps even inelegantly and sporadically, but I'll stick with my original claim.Here's how you do it:1. Get your chocolate right next to your gold leaf envelope and carefully open the top paper from the leaf.2. Turn it upside down onto your chocolate and brush gently with your soft brush. It'll probably tear a little bit, but that's fine. With enough practise you'll know how much pressure to apply to smooth the leaf and how much to apply to break a bit off.3. Tastefully apply in this manner and smooth the leaf onto the chocolate. The colder the chocolate is here, the better the result will be.4. Um...that's the extend of my expertise on this matter. It'll largely be trial and error here, but just do your best and try a few different things. At least you can always eat what goes wrong! What could be better! And with every bite you're adding value to your worthless carcass!

She won't be swooning in your arms if you crudely wrap them up in newspaper or put them in a cleaned out tin of 40/20 multigrade. You'll need to think how a women thinks and find something soft, girly and possibly even pink to put them in.Luckily, I had something that I could recycle in the house, so I didn't have to be seen outside with a pink silk box - phew! But at any rate, be practical and line it with tissue paper (from the crafting store) and place chocs gently into the box. If you have enough chocs to make a few layers then separate out with bits of grease-proof paper otherwise thely'll all stick together and the leaf will transfer between them. Not nice.And that's pretty much it.

When I first read about color changing food pigments I could barely contain my glee.", "images": ["color-changing-cocktails_0"], "origin_id": 40194}
{"chunk_id": "40194_2", "text": "I mean, think of the possibilities: a dish that can change COLORS? It turns out that lots of plants have pigment molecules that are pH indicators. In a neutral or basic solution they will appear green-blue or blue-purple, but add some acid and they'll turn purple or red. (You've probably seen examples of this already: blueberries in blueberry pancakes will sometimes turn green if the batter has too much baking soda, or brush your teeth with a baking soda toothpaste after drinking a glass of red wine and you'll end up with a mouthful of blue foam.) Lots of dishes get a little something acidic thrown in at the end, so it didn't seem like making a dish to use this color-change trick would be too difficult. My very first experiments quickly showed that I would need a mostly clear solution in order to show off the color change. (Opaque foods just muddied it up and got in the way). So I got to work trying out all sorts of ingredients with color-changing pigments: radicchio, red cabbage, blueberries. The findings of these tests were disappointing. Either the color would come out muddied and dull (blueberries) or the flavor would be horrid (red cabbage) or both (radicchio). And that's not even getting to the hardest part: acidity. Nearly everything that we eat is acidic. Egg whites and most tap water are slightly basic, but everything else is just varying degrees of acidity. For the color change to work, you need an acid addition that will significantly change the pH, but not until the dish is served. (So adding any acid to the mix beforehand is a no-go.) And this makes adding any flavor difficult. Just about every flavor-enhancing technique I thought of either muddied up the color or added acid. Perhaps, I thought, this is a phenomenon that works great in an eighth grade chemistry class, but really shouldn't be brought into the kitchen. And then I met this little blue flower.(Hello, butterfly blue pea flower!) It doesn't seem to have much of an audience in the US yet, but Thai and Chinese cooks have long used this little flower to color foods and make teas with a brilliant blue hue. For my money, this is truly a remarkable ingredient. For one thing, it's hard to overstate how brilliant the color from this flower is. The pigment is highly soluble-- you don't even have to boil it to release the color. And since the flowers can be dried, it is easy to keep them on hand. The only slight detractor is that they don't have any real flavor on their own. But even that negative can be a boon-- you could use these little guys to color any sort of dish, and add whatever flavors you want separately. Finally I had an ideal candidate to make a color-changing recipe, and I decided a fancy cocktail would be just the thing to showcase this remarkable little ingredient. I chose to make an alcoholic beverage, but there is no reason that the same techniques wouldn't work for non-alcoholic beverages. Step 1: The \"Secret\" Ingredient. <PIC> The first (and most difficult) part of making this drink will be getting your hands on some butterfly blue pea flowers. (Unless you happen to live in Thailand. Then it seems like it will be quite easy.) I have found the easiest way to get these guys is to order through amazon. Search for butterfly blue pea flowers in tea, and you'll find a few vendors that carry them. The catch is, they all ship from Thailand, and shipping to the US usually takes about a month. They aren't cheap (with shipping my order was around 20$), but the 50g. bag that I bought will definitely make around 5 bottles of color-changing liquor. And the dried flowers keep well, so you could get quite a lot of use out of an order. While it isn't easy to get your hands on dried flowers in the US, it is fairly easy to get seeds. So the other option is to grow the plant yourself. I was so intrigued by this little flower, I decided to try my hand at growing some fresh ones in my backyard this year.", "images": ["color-changing-cocktails_1"], "origin_id": 40194}
{"chunk_id": "40194_3", "text": "I am by no means an expert gardener, but I can share a few tips that I've figured out from growing this little guy. (And, if we're being honest, killing off some other seedlings along the way) 1. Use a bean/pea innoculant when you start your seeds. I tried germinating two batches of seeds, one with innoculant and one without. I got a MUCH better germination rate (around 70%) with innoculant as compared to 33% without. 2. Heat, heat, heat. Unlike regular garden peas, these guys like it hot. I started some seedlings on a heating mat, which seemed to work. But my attempts to harden off plants to grow outside in colder temperatures (60-70s F) were not successful. The healthy plant that I grew was started indoors with lots of light, and I didn't move it outdoors until the temperature lows were in the 70s (mid-summer here in New York). You also want to plant them in well-drained soil, and don't over-water them. (This plant likes soil on the dry side.) 3. This plant has delicate roots and does not like being repotted. I would suggest starting seedlings in peat pots so you don't need to disturb the roots when transferring them to a container or the ground. 4. Give them a trellis or fence to climb on. Like other varieties of peas, this plant only seems to flower once it has reached a certain height. (Then the extending vines produce lots of flowers. ) 5. If you want to have enough blossoms to make a bottle of color-changing gin, you'll probably need several plants. I'm estimating that my single vine will produce about 2 dozen blossoms this year. That's not bad, but it would only make about a quarter of a bottle of liquor. The plants really are stunning, though. And the fresh flowers can be eaten and used as a garnish on all sorts of dishes. I'll definitely be planting them again next year. Step 2: Elements of a Color-Changing Cocktail.", "images": ["color-changing-cocktails_2"], "origin_id": 40194}
{"chunk_id": "40194_4", "text": "<PIC> To create a color-changing cocktail I knew I would need a butterfly blue pea-infused liquor, and then an acidic addition to activate the color change. I also wanted to add some other flavors and a little sweetness to the cocktail. After a little poking around, I found out that most vodkas and gins have a neutral or near-neutral pH. I chose gin for my cocktail, but vodka would work just as well. Adding other flavors gets a little tricky-- it's hard to add anything into the mix without inadvertently adding acid. (And we want to save that for the dramatic finale.) I found that creating a syrup with fresh herbs did not add too much acidity, and could still bring lots of flavor with them. I chose to make a light syrup, (not that high of a sugar concentration) just because I don't like my drinks very sweet. I was going for flavor, with just enough sweetness to cut the harshness of the gin and balance the acid addition. I also found that infusing a hot syrup gently (rather than boiling it) will give you a syrup that is more clear. It's not totally colorless, but it's clear enough so the color-changing effect isn't noticeably diminished. The last element was the acid. I tried a number of combinations of floral and herbal syrups with different acids (including some interesting experiments with white balsamic vinegar and vermouth.) The clear favorite in the taste category was basil syrup with fresh lime juice. I'm sure that there are other winning combinations out there-- I anxiously await to hear more ideas from all you talented mixologists... The one caveat I would add is that you get the most dramatic color change effect when you add a strong, liquid acid. (I did some tests with powdered citric acid and frozen lime juice: meh.) The most satisfying display was with just plain lime juice. I specify straining the lime juice to try to keep the drink as clear as possible. Step 3: The Indigo Blush (My Recipe for a Color-Changing Cocktail). <PIC> Indigo Blush: 2 oz. Blue Gin 1 oz. Basil Lemongrass Syrup 1 oz. Strained Lime JuiceBlue Gin: 1\u20442 bottle dry gin 3-4 T dried butterfly blue pea flowers baking sodaBasil Syrup: 1 c. sugar 1 1\u20442c.spectrum with the addition of the syrup, you might need to add just a pinch of baking soda to push the pH back toward neutral. Again, go slow, and make sure not to overdo the baking soda. Shake in a cocktail shaker and pour into a martini glass. To complete the cocktail slowly pour 1 oz. of strained lime juice into the glass. (This would be the recommended moment to stop for a few minutes to bask in the the oohs and ahs.)Tips for Cocktail Brilliance. Since the color is the star of this show, it really pays to have a white background. (It is much harder to see the color change against a dark background or competing colors.) A white tablecloth or plate underneath the drinks works wonders. If you have enough flowers, you can make the drink as intensely blue as you want. BUT I find that you lose some of the brilliance of the color if it is very highly concentrated. When the drink changes colors it will also appear to lighten. So expect that your finished purple drink will look lighter than the initial blue base.", "images": ["color-changing-cocktails_3"], "origin_id": 40194}

{"chunk_id": "40203_1", "text": "Introduction: Superior Soreen - Breadmaker Malt Loaf. <PIC> I love Soreen malt loaf, but since acquiring a breadmaking machine I prefer to bake my own bread. I couldn't find a breadmaker recipe anywhere for a traditional northern malt loaf, so I experimented to produce my own. For those unfortunate enough never to have tasted malt loaf, it's a sweetish, malt-flavoured tea bread that is full of dried fruit. A buttered slice is a classic teatime treat in the north of England, but it's also delicious toasted and spread with jam for breakfast or as a late night snack. Since devising a recipe that works in a breadmaker I can have freshly made, mostly wholemeal, malt loaf whenever I want it, but without the Soreen ingredients I'd rather avoid (like palm oil and preservatives). Eaten in moderation, it's an excellent way of getting goodness-rich foods such as extract of malt, dried fruit, milk and wholemeal flour into children. If you use soya milk or another plant-based milk, it's suitable for vegans.I use a Panasonic breadmaker which has a \"speciality raisin\" programme.", "images": ["superior-soreen-breadmaker-malt-loaf_0"], "origin_id": 40203}

Some people prefer a sticky, squidgy texture, others a drier, firmer loaf that is more like an ordinary loaf of bread. The measurements below are a mix of Imperial (UK) and metric, but I've given some rough US conversions for the milk and water. Actually, the precise quantities aren't too important, so much depends on things such as how dry the flour is, how accurately you can measure a spoonful of malt or treacle, the baking temperature of your breadmaker and your personal preference as to the final loaf texture. So give it a try, making notes on how much of everything you used, and be prepared to make adjustments to get the result you want. Ingredients1 teaspoon (5 ml) fast-acting dried yeast (the type meant for using in breadmakers) 6oz sultanas or plump raisins (or a mix) 12 oz strong wholemeal flour 6oz strong white flour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) vegetable oil (eg sunflower or olive) 1 dessertspoon malt extract 1 dessertspoon black treacle 300 ml (about 10 US fluid oz) semi-skimmed milk, or soya milk 100 ml (about 3.5 US fluid oz) water Step 1: Loading the Breadmaker. <PIC> Mix the two flours together. Place the yeast first into the breadmaker's pan in a little heap on one side. Then add all the other dry ingredients except for the fruit, on top. Finally, add the liquid ingredients on the opposite side of the pan to the yeast - the aim is to keep the yeast dry for as long as possible. If your breadmaker has a separate dispenser for fruit and nuts then put the sultanas or raisins in there, otherwise keep them back for now. For breadmakers that can bake different sizes of loaf, choose the size setting that is most appropriate for the quantities you're using. For my Panasonic, that's XL.Set the breadmaker going on the \"speciality raisin\" programme, or whatever other programme your machine may have that is intended for fruit breads.", "images": ["superior-soreen-breadmaker-malt-loaf_1"], "origin_id": 40203}

{"chunk_id": "40244_3", "text": "eet, butteredWaxed paperThe recipeSo if you've checked out the recipe, it's pretty confusing. She never used a candy thermometer and relied only on what the sugar did when you dropped it into cold water. I'm not going to be using a candy thermometer either, so in the next step, I'll review the stages sugar goes through when boiled. Step 2: Soft-Ball to Hard-Crack: Stages of Candy-Making. When you mix sugar syrup and water and heat, the water boils out. The mixture of heat and water loss is what gets you to the correct stage of candy hardness for the appropriate type of candy you're making. For instance, I sometimes make \"no-bake cookies\" and boil sugar and water for a minute and a half and they harden up just right even without testing the hardness of the sugar beforehand. However, my boyfriend has never had them come out right - my guess is that he doesn't boil the sugar long enough!Stages of SugarSoft-Ball StageThe sugar for no-bake cookies is boiled until it reaches the Soft-Ball Stage. At this stage, the mixture ranges from 235\u00b0 F\u2013240\u00b0 F and has a sugar concentration of 85%.In the absence of a candy thermometer, when you drop some of the sugar syrup into cold water, it will form a ball that, when removed by hand, will flatten.Firm-Ball StageEver made caramel? You probably cooked the sugar until it reaches the Firm-Ball Stage. We'll be using this stage for this recipe too. The mixture is now 245\u00b0 F\u2013250\u00b0 F and the sugar concentration has raised 2% to 87%. A ball will still form when dropped in cold water, but when removed, it will not flatten until squeezed. In this recipe, when it first mentions hard ball, it actually means this stage, as some of the mixture will be cooked longer until it reaches the next stage.Hard-Ball StageFor this recipe, we're looking to get to the Hard-Ball Stage. Once past the firm-ball stage, there's a little more leeway on temperature range: 250\u00b0 F\u2013265\u00b0 F. The sugar concentration is up to 92% at this point, so when the sugar drips from the spoon into the cold water, it does so in thick strands. Once in water, it forms a hard ball that doesn't flatten when picked up unless you really squish it. This stage is what is referred to in the recipe when it says \"until it bounces off the table\".Crack StagesPast the ball stages, you reach the Soft-Crack and the Hard-Crack Stages. During the Soft-Crack Stage, the temperature is between 270\u00b0 F\u2013290\u00b0 F and the sugar concentration is 95%. In cold water, the syrup will form threads that will bend before breaking. The Soft-Crack Stage is what my sugar syrup mixture ended as. During the Hard-Crack Stage, the temperature is between 300\u00b0 F\u2013310\u00b0 F and the sugar concentration is 99%. In cold water, the syrup forms threads that break when bent.Higher TempsAnything past the above stage will get you caramelized (brown liquid) sugar, where all of the water has evaporated. I won't be talking about these here. Now to begin! Step 3: Prepare the Eggs and Pecans. <PIC> PecansGoing with tradition, I used whole pecans.", "images": ["divinity-chews_3"], "origin_id": 40244}

Step 2: Making the Candy. <PIC> To make gummies the only essential ingredient is unflavored gelatin. For flavor I used flavored gelatin (Jello is one brand) plus a Vitamin C to bump up the pucker power.

{"chunk_id": "40288_4", "text": "latin you use is up to you. I'm recommending a full package of flavored gelatin for each batch. It gives the candy a pretty intense flavor. Use an extra packet of unflavored gelatin, and they will be even chewier. Use one less, and they will be softer.HERE WE GO: 'You might look at all the writing below and think that this is way too much work. All you are going to be doing though, is mixing the powder in water, melting it and pouring it into molds. I've just written a ton, so you know a lot of the pitfalls and know exactly how I make them.' If you don't really care how clear the candy is, just stir the powders in the water, put it in hot water on the stove and melt it, then pour it in the molds. If you want them really clear then read the details below. I use a little over 1/3 cup of water (you can use even more for softer candies). Measure 1/3 - 1/2 cup of cold water into your measuring cup.MIX IT UPSPRINKLE the gelatin powders into the water, as you continuously and gently stir it. Don't let the dry powder pile up. Sprinkle, stir, sprinkle, stir,...If you get a pile of gelatin and stir that in, it will make a lump, and lumps are hard to dissolve once you've made one. Do this rather quickly. The gelatin will immediately start absorbing the water. If you move too slowly it will get pretty dry towards the end and it will be very difficult to avoid lumps. It will get very thick as you work in the powders. Sometimes it ended up like a lump of clay. Add just a tiny bit more water to the mix to get a slushy consistency. Either way will work fine. Scrape down the sides of your measuring cup and try to get all the gelatin down in contact with the wet stuff.LET IT REST Cover the pyrex cup with plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes. The gelatin needs time to absorb the water before we heat it. You can leave the spatula in the gelatin while it is resting, but don't leave any chunks of gelatin on the back of the spatula where it will dry.I'M MELTING... Put a pan of water on the stove and bring it up to a slow boil/fast simmer. In the photos I'm using a shallow pan. I only did that so I could photograph the sides of the cup and let you see what was happening. I use a deeper sauce pan when I make them now. After the resting time, remove the plastic wrap and put the measuring cup in the water. The lump of clay or slushy material will melt but it does take several minutes. Occasionally stir it. Stir it gently. Don't get too vigorous and mix a lot of air in it, or you will have cloudy candy. (If you are adding vitamin C to sour them up, add it at the very end.) Once it melts, you will see that it has a layer of foam on top. Try to avoid mixing that foam back into the melted syrup. When it is hot enough you will see there is a very thin layer of clear on the bottom, a layer that isn't as clear, then the layer of foam on top. Now stop stirring and just let it sit in the water for about 2 minutes. We are letting bubbles rise at this point. * For very clear candies: After melting the candy, put the pyrex cup in the fridge.Let it firm up. Then remove it from the cup and using a pair of scissors, cut it into chunks. Then using a knife or your scissors, carefully trim the foamy layer off. Remelt the clear chunks and you will end up with very clear syrup. Details of this process are in Step 5.FINALLY WE FILL THE MOLD Now I put my syringe into the bottom of the cup and suck up all that clear syrup. I use the syringe to squirt the candy into my mold. (Step 4 has other ways of molding the candy). If your mold won't hold all the syrup you made, turn the heat off and let the cup sit in the water while your first batch of candy is setting up. When you pull the first batch out of the mold, just turn on the stove and melt the syrup that is still in the cup the same way we did it the first time. You don't need to use any kind of release (no oil or cooking sprays) with gummies. They will peel off of anything that is smooth. If you get some on your stove, floor, or counter, don't bother to try to clean it up while it is wet and hot. It's much easier to just let it set up and peel it off. Most of the time when you make gummies you will not try to mold them in 360 degrees. The top side (which will be the bottom of the candies) is just left flat. I wanted to mold in little holes on the bottom of in my bricks so I could actually stack them. The syrup contracts quite a lot as it cools. I had to fill the mold, then go back through and top them all off again as it would shrink way down. When I got them all full, I took the base plate (the same one I used when making the mold) and pressed it on the top of the mold, squeezing any extra goo out of the sides. Then I let it sit on the counter top for a couple of minutes. I do that, just so the stuff that leaked out the sides would set up and it wouldn't get all over my freezer when I put the mold in there. I put the mold with the lid (base plate) into the freezer. You only leave it in the freezer for 10 or 15 minutes.If you are going to leave it longer, or you think you might forget it, you can just stick it in the fridge. It will be fine there without any worries about leaving it too long. These candies actually do not need to be refrigerated at all to set up. You can just leave your mold on the counter at room temperature and they will still set up. I use the freezer to get them done faster. Once they are set up, take them out of the mold. Clean them up if they need it, and you are done. Step 3: Add Some Pucker Power - Sour Gummies. <PIC> Sour Gummies I really like sour flavors in gummy candies. The official way to make sour gummies is to add Ascorbic Acid Powder. Other powders that will add sour are called Citric Acid or Vitamin C powder. You can buy it in a cooking store, a health food store that sells supplements, probably some pharmacies and I think it's even available at some bulk food stores. Sometimes it is incredibly expensive, especially if it is from some \"Life", "images": ["legummies-brick-shaped-gummy-candies_3"], "origin_id": 40288}
{"chunk_id": "40288_5", "text": "Extension\" or \"Body Cleansing\" type of vitamin company. I've never bothered with buying the powder. Ascorbic acid is Vitamin C. I just grind up a Vitamin C tablet with my mortar and pestle. The cheaper the vitamin C the better the flavor I think. Rose hips Vitamin C is not as sour, and has some kind of non sour flavor. I'm not really sure how to describe it. I'm not sure what the chewables, or timed released Vitamin C's would do, or how they would taste. The added ingredients in those vitamins might not like being heated, and they might cloud up your candies. Just stick to plain cheap generic Vitamin C if you are going to grind your own. For pure sour pucker power, the cheaper the better.I add the powder of one 500mg Vitamin C to a batch of gummies. That will change the flavor so it doesn't taste so much like a Jello Flavor. I LOVE 3 Vitamin C's - that's a great candy flavor to me. It's one of those things you just have to do by taste. You might like more, or less, than I do.The easiest way to sour up gummies, and to also give them more concentrated flavor is to add unsweetened Kool-Aid powder! There are a lot of flavor experiments you can try by mixing different flavored gelatin with different flavors of Kool-Aid. They don't come out very clear though. There are all the other kind of powdered drink mixes. I don't know how they would react if you stirred them into the hot gummy syrup, but I'm sure they would be fine if you rolled the candies in them when you were finished. A good lemonade powder mix would probably taste pretty good.After it is melted and almost ready to go into the mold, stir in the Vitamin C, then let the syrup sit in the bath for a couple of minutes. This info applies to candy making in general: When making candy, you will almost always add the flavorings right at the end. The reason is, sometimes flavorings can change flavor or breakdown completely when they are heated. When you are making candy, you will usually cook your candy first, then stir in flavorings right after you take it off the stove. Have fun and experiment. Step 4: Molds. <PIC> You don't need to make a custom mold like I did to make gummy candies. There are many great silicone molds available. They are used for making candies, baking, molding butter, making ice,... It doesn't have to be made of silicone either. A regular Ice tray will work too. Any thing that has a flat and smooth surface should work fine. I read a suggestion, by a Mom on some recipe site, to pull the rack out of your toaster oven, put a piece of foil on it, and push the foil down through the slats. She made a gummy worm mold that way. This stuff is very forgiving.Mold Options Pour the candy in a flat pan and after it has gelled, then just slice it into squares, rectangles and triangles with a knife. You could cut shapes out with cookie cutters. You could even peel the sheet off in one piece, and cut it up with scissors. Whatever you do, I'd recommend you keep them pretty small. If you are using an ice tray, or a butter mold, or any mold with large compartments, don't fill it to the top.", "images": ["legummies-brick-shaped-gummy-candies_4"], "origin_id": 40288}

They are a Sculpture Tools, Materials and Supplies store in San Francisco. They are really great folks and have some incredible casting materials that you can't find anywhere else. I bet you MythBusters buys their Ballistics Gel there. Well, I guess I shouldn't bet. Where they bought it is probably on the web, and I've already spent enough money on this project. The number I used is FGS-2237 Food Grade Silicone. (There is a new number MC-1287) Here is a link You need two parts. Part A is the silicone gel and part B is the catalyst. They sell it as aset. This is a 1 lb. set. The silicone must be weighed to make sure you put in the right amount of catalyst. It's 10 parts Silicone (part A) to 1 part Catalyst (part B). Buy yourself a gram scale to do this. You really want to be accurate. You don't want to waste this stuff because you measured wrong. I made my positive (the part that I made the mold from) out of - you guessed it - Legos! When I was a kid, way back in the last Century, Legos were still this strange toy from Scandinavia. That was where all the \"adult\" films and Anita Eckberg came from - she was our Paris Hilton. She was beautiful, classy, spoke with a sultry Swedish accent, and went to the best parties. Well I guess she wasn't very Paris Hiltonish at all. The only kids who had Legos were the ones who had Moms, or Grandparents, from Europe, or a Dad that we never saw, because he was always \"away on business\". Those kids got cool gifts. You could tell some of them came from the Airport gift store though. I had an Erector set and was very happy with it.Woops Sorry I got sidetracked -HOW TO MAKE THE MOLD As I was saying, I never had Legos and I still didn't have any when I decided to make this project. I visited the Lego website and found a set that I really wanted that had enough pieces for my mold and bought that. I planned what I needed with the Lego Digital Designer. It's a free software program you can download from Lego and it lets you build Lego stuff in VR. It will even count up the pieces for you and place an order. I wanted my tray to not waste any space. If I left more than a single peg between each candy piece I'd be wasting the silicone. When I got the Legos - I built the Taj Mahal - I couldn't resist! Have you seen it? It's amazing. 5,922 pieces. So three days later, after I finished the Taj, I started taking it apart to get my candy mold pieces. I put the pieces on a tray, and ringed the tray edge with a double stack of pieces to act as a wall and hold the silicone in (there is a photo ofit below). Legos are made so well, that they really fit tightly together. I found that I didn't have to seal any of the cracks between the pieces inside. Silicone will not stick to Legos. So you don't need to put any kind of mold release on the positive. Just stick the pieces in there and make sure you stick them down really good.Weigh the Silicone To measure how much silicone you are going to need to fill the mold, you can measure it a couple of ways. The standard way is to fill the positive with water, pour the water into the plastic cup you are going to mix it in, and just draw a line on the cup at the water line. That is how much silicone you will need to fill the mold. You can't let any water get anywhere near your silicone before you cast it though. If you measure your mold with water, make sure you allow plenty of time for it to get bone dry before you try to make your mold. To avoid the water problem I used Lentils - yeah like in the soup - but dry ones. They have some really small black ones at the bulk food store and they don't put out any dust, so they are great for this. Just pour the lentils over your positive, then pour them into your mixing container. They don't mess your positive up at all.Then you don't have to worry about liquid spoiling your mold. Put your plastic container - with the line marked on it, on your gram scale and set the scale to zero. That way you won't be weighing your plastic cup, just the silicone. Now pour enough of Part A to get up to your marked line. Don't just glop it in there, try to avoid causing any air pockets. Check to see how much the silicone weighs. Let's say it measured 350g. Because you use 10 parts A and 1 part B, you will need 10% of that weight in Catalyst or 35g. Zero (sometimes the button you use to do this is labeled \"Tare\") your scale out, with the silicone still on it. Then add the 35g of Part B right into the same container.Mix it up Mix your Part A and your Part B with something plastic. The catalyst is blue and the silicone is white so you can tell if you have it mixed. Scrape the sides and bottom as you do it. You want to be careful not to mix any extra air into it. Does that sound familiar? Just like the Gummies! If you really want to make a perfect mold then you have to \"de-air\" the silicone. As this involves putting it in a vacuum chamber and most of us don't have one, you can just skip that step. There are lots of tips on the web on how to get the least bubbly silicone castings.Pour it in your tray You will pour the mixed silicone over the positive. Fill the tray up until you cover the tops of the pieces. Pour slowly and don't move the Silicone back and forth like you are drizzling on frosting. That will leave air bubbles in the corners around your pieces. Pour it in a stream that hits the bottom of the tray - not over the Lego pieces, and let it flow around the tray and fill it up. This will help you avoid trapping any air. Silicone is pretty good about releasing bubbles so you probably will get a pretty good mold. I'd tap the tray a few times, and I've even held a back massager against it to help it release any air.You need to be very careful, that any of this tapping, or vibrating doesn't loosen any of the pieces inside the mold. I did a test piece and when I was tapping it, one of them floated to the top! I just grabbed my plastic spoon and pushed it back down. The only problem it caused was I wasted silicone, because the inside filled up. Avoid that by making sure your pieces are stuck down really well before you pour in the Silicone.Let it set up Don't try to clean up the cup and tools right now. Let them sit overnight. Most of it will set up and you can just peel it off. If you find you have any sticky spots of silicone gel, you can clean those off by dabbing them with a little Catalyst. That will make them set up and you should be able to peel it off. Let the silicone set at least overnight, then just pull the Legos out of it. They will come out veryeasily. Let it set up for 24 hours before you use it. I put mine in the oven at 175 degrees for about 15 minutes after it had already been curing for 24 hours, just to make sure. It might not have been the right thing to do (I should have asked Douglas and Sturgess) but I knew they did that with some of the other silicones. After you get the Legos out, just trim off any of the little bits that squeezed between the pieces. Wash the mold and you are ready to go. Now if you will excuse me, I have to go rebuild the Taj Mahal. Step 5: Addendum: How to Get Really Clear Candies. <PIC> ADDENDUM: How to get very clear candies I figured out how to get really clear candies with almost no bubbles. I started by straining my vitamin C through a paper coffee filter so I got most of the solids out. I ended up with a very sour liquid that looked like water. The secret to clear candies is to melt it twice. After the first cycle of heating, let it rest, and cool off in the refrigerator. Almost all of the bubbles will rise to the surface while it is cooling.can siphon that out with your syringe if you want. I just pour it in to about spoon sized circles on a silicone baking mat. Then I peel those dots up when they solidify and put them in a baggy for me to eat. They taste just as good. Melt all of those clear chunks. No real need to stir it while it is melting. I leave it alone so I don't add any bubbles. I just give it a gentle stir at the end before I suck it up into the syringe. This technique makes amazingly clear candies. I have two pyrex cups so I make a second batch while the first one is cooling, then while No. 2 cools, I cut the foam layer off No.1 and melt it for casting.", "images": ["legummies-brick-shaped-gummy-candies_5"], "origin_id": 40288}

Try not to get any yolk in the bowl. - Batter with a mixer or a fork until the egg whites have risen to a thick froth. -Pour on a couple of spoons of brown sugar, this depends on taste. I usually do two full spoons for the 3 egg whites. - Then continue to mix and pour in your favorite red wine. I usually use Tempranillo wine (my favorite red) - Then serve on a wine glass and top it with grated cinnamon. -Also, if you want more wine, serve yourself more.

Preheat your electric griddle to 350 degrees F. 2. In your food processor, put the bananas, eggs, oats and salt. Process on high speed until completely smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and mix again until there are no lumps. 3. Pour your batter into a bowl. Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, scoop the batter onto your griddle. This will make perfectly round 4-5 inch pancakes. Sprinkle the pancakes with chocolate chips (or blueberries....). 4. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and begin to pop.Flip over and cook for another 60-90 seconds. 5. Serve immediately (I serve these plain because the chocolate chips make them sweet enough).

We toasted coconut flakes and topped the cake with it to resemble packing material - we also stuck some on the sides so it looked like it was coming through the slats.

I wanted to make tasty muffins with them so I made these beauties!One muffin really fills you up with deliciousness & goodness for your body! They aren\u2019t that sweet either. I also made them vegan! ;) Yeah! :) They are great as a lovely breakfast on the go, or when you sit down with a good vegan caf\u00e9 latte. I enjoy them with some vegan butter! :)These also make an excellent food gift, just see for yourself! :)Recipe: For 15 larger flower-shaped muffinsIngredients: * The dry ingredients: 2 cups of buckwheat flour 1 cup of brown rice flour 1 cup of gluten-free rolled oats 1 large juicy apple, peeled, cored & cut up into smaller chunks 1 tablespoon + 1/2 tablespoon gluten-free baking powder 1/2 teaspoon finely grinned Maldon sea salt, in a pestle & mortar 2/3 cup coconut sugar 3 tablespoons grinned flaxseed/ I ground broken flaxseed in my dry container of my Vitamix on full-speed until it resembles a flour.\u2019t want the air to be gone! ;) I use silicon flower mats so I don\u2019t have to grease them. With the help of a larger spoon, spoon your muffin mix for 3/4 into the flower muffin mat. I have larger flower muffin shapes then the normal muffins so you will end up with huger flower-shaped muffins! I could fill 15 flower-shaped muffins. I place them on a Silpat on an oven rack for stability. Place them in the lower side of your oven & bake for about 20 minutes until a test pin comes out clean. Leave the muffins in their silicon casings for about 10 minutes. This way, your muffins will get a lovely shine on them & they are easily to remove. After these 10 minutes, carefully flip them over & out of the mats & place on a cooling rack to cool down or savor them still a bit warm with some vegan butter & a vegan caf\u00e9 latte!

It has incredible capacity for fine detailing much like sculpey. You can roll it out paper thin and tool it with fine detail in a way you can not with chocolate or fondant. You can create life like objects with gum paste. Look at how crazy this guy is! Soooo good! Look how good you can get if this was you job!Making a lot of flowers takes time as you make each petal individually. It's a rather meditative practice. the cake pictured here took about 6 hours in sculpting time.Gum paste is more brittle than fondant when it dries.", "images": ["floral-tentacle-cake_0"], "origin_id": 40567}
{"chunk_id": "40567_2", "text": "It is not delicious to eat, so I don't even bother making it from scratch, although it is easy to make. Gum paste dries fast and hard, so you have to know what you are doing but it also is not difficult to sculpt with. This is actually an ok first project to learn with, since you use a variety of different methods to make flowers and it takes very little practiced skill. You do not need to make the exact flowers I make. Use what tools you have on hand, the techniques are similar for a wide variety of decor. A lily is very similar to an orchid or poppy in how it is constructed. You can guesstimate how to make any flower after you see how the techniques work.For this gum paste tutorial you need specialized tools but you can fudge it ok with some kitchen items:a bucket of gum paste. I get a pound of Satin Ice brand paste. It seems to last forever if wrapped up tight. corn starch (powdered sugar works too) shortening modeling tools: ball rollers, (you can use a kit like Wilton or clay modeling tools dedicated to kitchen use. I had an old wilton kit with the plastic green tools. The nicer end ones are made of metal. They all work very similarly.) thin foams for rolling out petals food safe floral wire, tape and stamen assortment toothpicks cookie cutter shapes for petals and leaves plastic leaf veining form for leaves flower punch molder rolling pin egg carton or very small bowls (I used some spoons too) to let the flowers dry in a supported cup shape gel coloring pastes (not liquid color)Here are some tips for working with gum paste:work with small amounts because it dries out fast. I keep small bits rolled up in balls under a glass. I also store petals and leaves under a glass until it is time to detail them. rub shortening on gum paste if it dries out. Coat it with small bit of corn starch if it is too greasy, if hand mixing darker colors, use gloves. don't rush. Make these weeks in advance.It is better this way as they need to dry out sometimes for a week anyway to stiffen up and if you are a beginner very often after the drying period bits with crack and fall off and you might need to make more. try to make more items than you need as delicate flowers are fragile. You will have unsuccessful flowers. I have about a 10% throw away rate with this batch. Step 1: Gum Paste Wild Roses. <PIC> With a toothpick, tint a tiny thumb size bit of gum paste a pale yellow color. I use gel coloring paste so that it doe not affect the rigidity of the gum paste. 1. Roll small balls of yellow gum paste in your palms, paying attention to smoothness. cut your stamen to under half an inch and stick them in the balls. I used around 7 stamens for each ball.Each wild rose will have five petals. Make an extra petal for each rose so you can select the best one.2.

{"chunk_id": "40567_3", "text": "your gum paste from the center to the edges to under 1/8 inch thick and use a petal shaped cutter to punch out your petals. There are two kinds of foams we will use for these flowers. The purple one is similar to kid's craft foam, dense and gives very little for applying pressure. we use this to thin out the petal. The pink foam is less dense and has a lot of give and is ideal for rippling the edges for a realistic petal appearance. 3. Place each petal on the harder purple gum paste foam first and roll it out with a ball modeler. Press in the middle first and roll it to wards the edges in a moon shape. You are trying to indent a petal shape very similar to the curvature of your own cupped palm. I leave a little extra gum paste around the edges so I can have more to work with for the next step.4. On the pink foam, use the same ball roller to press out the edges to create a rippled effect.5. Make a finger's amount of dusty green gum paste. Roll it out and punch out a few calyx shapes.I used spoons to create a cupping supportive shape for the roses to dry on. You could use small bowls or egg crates.I like having a little variety in the slope. the larger your vessel the more open your flower will be.6. While your petals sit for a few minutes, mix up gum paste glue. This is just pinching off a tiny bit of the gum paste and stirring water. My ratio is about a thumb nail ball of gum paste to a 1/4 cup of warm water. 7. Place the green calyx on the measuring spoon or cup. Wit ha small paint brush dab the center with your glue. add each white petal on one by one, overlapping just slightly every time you add a petal. Use the glue on the areas where the petals overlap. Brush on more glue in the center and lightly press your yellow ball in the center.8. Hope for the best. 9. Get floral wire and make a little hook on the end. Burn it on the stove so it is hot. press it into the bottom of your flower so it melts through and \"hooks\" in the thickest part. the gum paste should melt around it forming a permanent tomb for the wire.These took two days to dry because the center of the balls take a little bit. if a petal falls off use one of your spares to glue a fresh one back on. Step 2: Gum Paste Tentacles. <PIC> Oh my god this was monotonous to do. Look. I'm NOT a zen person. I can not really meditate. All that chat about meditating before is a big lie. I can't yoga. I just can't. If you are all namaste about stuff, this is gonna work out great for you. If not, just make a floral cake. No one will judge you. Tentacles are cool to look at though, and without them this cake would be a boring normal floral cake. I guess I lied about judging. Make the tentacles! You can do it!1.Mix up a fist and a half of fondant to a weird sickly squid color. You'll probably want to mix some red with brown and purple or blue. Mix a half a fist of gum paste to a weird underwater squid purple color these are for the suction cups.2.Roll out various sizes of squid tentacles using your pal. this is similar to making your average play doh snake shape.", "images": ["floral-tentacle-cake_2"], "origin_id": 40567}

Yup! Pretty cool. I also mixed a little gel dye and water up to brush on the petals to add color variation. I let some dry out in jar lids and some in measuring cups to have variance in bloom shapes.The small blue and white flowers were made by pressing gum paste in a typical wilton flower mold and popping a hooked wire in the center. these were made into bunches using floral tape. be sure to used food safe floral tape. The daisies were made with a daisy shape cutter and the centers were made with a style mold.The billy balls are rolled into balls and rolled over a bumpy plastic texturizer to create the feel of pollen. These balls were also hooked on to heated floral wire and were dried upside down on my dish rack.To create floral texture for large leaves, you cut the leaves out first then press them against the veining molds before you shape them very gently on the foams.If you want them on floral wire, you can stick the floral wires directly into balls of gum paste and roll it out after, in order to have a very stable leaf on a wire that is thin. use up your gum paste completely by making spirals and x-tra decorative elements.

I always frost a thin crumb coat on first and refrigerate the cake for 15 mins before doing an other layer, but since we are covering this in fondant it is not as important. Step 5: Decorate Cake. <PIC> Cover your cake in fondant.Do not use gum paste. fondant is soft and pliable. I usually serve my cakes by peeling the fondant off first unless someone is into eating it for some reason. fondant is not just a decorative element. it keeps your cakes study and moist and it is so great when you are transporting a cake and it has to sit around before cutting.Stick all your decor on the cake.You will want to use your glue for the flat pieces but in some cases it might be best to use a little butter cream icing. A lot of the flowers and leaves are not able to sit flush on the curved surface of the cake. icing helps that.Surprisingly, I had used the leftover bits of gum paste to shape small spirals and curly wiggle shapes.

In homebrewing, after you've boiled your wort (pre-beer, malty sugar water) for a while you want to cool it down as quickly as possible while also being completely sanitary in order to reduce the risk of contaminating your beer. There are a number of different tools at a homebrewer's disposal to accomplish this task ranging from simple to complex, and cheap to expensive. In this instructable I'm going to show you how I built an all-copper counter flow wort chiller. This particular model allows for thorough cleaning and visual inspection unlike most conventional spiraled versions, while costing about half as much as a store bought model.How does it work? My version of a wort chiller is know as a counter-flow chiller (CFC) which runs the wort through straight 1/2\" copper pipe that is encased by straight 3/4\" pipe. The cold water runs through the 3/4\" pipe and cools the wort down on its journey through the many sections. One advantage to this design is the 1/2\" diameter of the tubing. This size makes it almost impossible to clog with hop debris and cold break unlike traditional plate chillers and smaller diameter CFCs.", "images": ["heavy-duty-counter-flow-wort-chiller_0"], "origin_id": 40611}

Additionally, because the tubing is straight, it is easy to send a small pipe brush through each section unlike a traditional spiraled CFC. Lastly, the unit is fully submersible which allows the brewer to keep it in an ice-bath if desired to further increase cooling potential along with recirculating water for a greater higher water efficiency. The draw back is the price and the size. This unit will cost around $100 to build whereas a traditional round CFC can be built for about half as much.

{"chunk_id": "40611_4", "text": "You can make the chiller shorter while using the same amount of copper pipe, however you'll need more tee fittings (and silicone tubing), and you'll want to make sure the length of the inner pipe is evenly divisible by 10' to maximize your copper usage. For example, you could shorten the 1/2\" pipe to 24\" rather than 30\" and have10 sections rather than 8. This will then require another 2 tees and you'll need to adjust the 3/4\" pipe to match the new size. I will list the measurements I went with.-8x sections of 1/2\" pipe, 30\" long. Since each pipe is 10' you'll get 4x sections from each piece.-8x sections of 3/4\" pipe, 23\" long. -7x sections of 3/4\" pipe, 6\" long.Cut 4x 23\" sections from each 10' 3/4\" pipe. Cut 4x 6\" sections from one 3/4\" pipe and 3x 6\" sections from the other. This will leave you with 1 extra 4\" section and 1 extra 10\" section. Use the 4\" section for the final 2 pieces listed below.-2x sections of 3/4\" pipe, 2\" long. These will be for the connection between the first and last tees, and the 90 degree elbow fittings for the water inlet and outlet.At the end of all the cutting you should be left with the one extra 10\" section of 3/4\" pipe as a spare piece.By this point you should have all of your copper tubing cut and ready to do a dry-fit test! It was at this time that I found my first problem.My tee fittings (and most others by the sounds of it) have a tiny ridge or collar on the inside which prevent the 1/2 copper tubing from sliding completely through the fitting. Next I'll explain how I got around that problem... Step 3: Prepping and Threading the Pipe Through the Tees. <PIC> Once I had all my pipe cut to the right lengths, it was time to prepare it for soldering. First, I used what is called a deburring tool which scrapes the inner lip away from the copper to make a nice smooth interior. I only did this on the inside of the 1/2\" copper pipe where the wort would be flowing through. It is optional, but a good idea to prevent potential trub buildup inside the pipe. You can do the same thing with a dremel tool or a step bit. Once that was done I needed to prep the solder connections. To do this I needed to sand down every surface which needed to be soldered. This cleans the surface and allows for an good adhesion of the solder to the copper in the joints. I used 100 grit ", "images": ["heavy-duty-counter-flow-wort-chiller_3"], "origin_id": 40611}
{"chunk_id": "40611_5", "text": "sandpaper and sanded the ends of each pipe and the insides of each fitting. There are tools commercially available to do this much easier and faster for about $10, but I didn't have one on hand and sandpaper works just fine. After all the solder points were prepped I could begin assembling. This step was supposed to be one of the easier steps of the process. I assumed that I would be assembling the unit by threading the 1/2\" pipe all the way through the tee and the 3/4\" pipe around it. This turned out to be one of the more difficult tasks of the build... As I mentioned, the tees have a lip inside which prevent the tubing from going further than the intended coupling which unfortunately is the exact thing we want them to do. To remedy this I tried a number of different tactics. I tried a swaging tool which I couldn't get to work with the fitting. I tried a tapered metal rod but of course I couldn't find one the correct diameter. I tried brute force which began to work but since I'd need to disassemble, add flux, then do it all over again I knew this was not an option... I settled on simply using a dremel tool with a sanding bit which was just a hair smaller than the inner diameter of the copper tee.By running the sander over the lip in the tee, I was able to grind it down enough to the point where the tube was finally able to thread completely through the tee. I have also been told that a drill press would work nicely for this as well if you have the correct size bit.Once you grind down the ridges in your tee fittings, do another dry fit to make sure the 1/2\" pipes slide through all the fittings properly. Once you're sure everything fits together nicely you can disassemble it and prepare for soldering! Step 4: Soldering and Assembly. <PIC> Soldering copper pipe was completely new to me. I had never done it before and I was a little nervous to try a new technique on my expensive pile of copper.

{"chunk_id": "40611_6", "text": "oo anxious I was able to solder the whole chiller in just a few hours. There are 16 fittings with 3 joints each which meant a total of 48 solder points. I learned a few things through all of this which helped me out quite a bit and I hope it will help you as well.I soldered the chiller as I would have assembled it, by starting with the bottom pipes and working my way up. Since The whole joint heats up when you are soldering a single connection, I fount it to be most economical to solder all 3 connections of each fitting at once. This meant adding flux to the inside of each fitting and each pipe end, then sliding the pipe into the tee. The 1/2\" pipe should stick out 1.5 inches from the outside of the tee fitting, and the 3/4\" pipe should fit snug until it hits the stop on the inside of each fitting. Once assembled, heat the joint with the blow torch using a decent sized flame. Trying to do it with a smaller flame takes forever and does not get the fitting hot enough to melt the solder. Once the fitting is nice and hot, test it by touching the solder to the connection point between the pipe and fitting. You're looking for the pipe to melt the solder, not the flame.If you put the solder directly into the flame this will just melt the solder and not let it enter the joint. If the joint is hot enough the solder will melt and capillary action assisted by the flux will draw the solder deep into the joint. I found it easiest to touch the solder to the top of the joint and let it flow down and get drawn into one side, then the other. Add solder until it begins to build up at the base of the joint. This means the joint is full of solder and you can move on. Double check all parts of the connection to ensure there is solder in the joint. Once you've completed the first two straight sections and the one connection pipe between the two, you'll be soldering a tee which is directly over the first one you did. As you heat the new fitting, you don't want your first fitting heating up and loosening, so I found it best to lay a damp cloth over the set joint and wedging a small piece of wood between the pipes to keep the tees apart just a little bit. Continue in this manner until all of your joints are soldered and your chiller is assembled!Once you're all done soldering then you're almost done. Clean off the extra flux with a damp cloth and some soapy water. Take your silicone tubing and cut it into 7x 10\" sections. This will connect each straight section of 1/2\" tube to the next. They will stay very firmly in place with nothing more than friction, so there is no need to further secure these. Last but not least, take your garden hose, chop off the two ends, put the hose clamp onto each section of hose end and work it onto the ends of the 90 degree elbows. You want the water inlet to be on the bottom and the outlet to be on the top. The hot wort will enter on top thorugh the tee with the water outlet and the wort will exit on the bottom with the water inlet tee. Once the hoses are on, secure them to the copper with the hose clamps. Step 5: Final Product and Future Plans.he chiller, and I plan to add proper brass male and female GHT (garden hose thread) sections to the chiller at some point, but this is good enough for now. Additionally, I plan on weaving some copper wire back and forth between the pipes to shore it up and make sure it is nice and straight, but it is plenty strong enough as it is to stay together just by the solder connections alone.

However in my case, I didn't exactly have a cider press sitting around waiting to be used, so I built this little jig over the weekend. The frame is made out of some scrap 4x4s and 2x4s, the plunger out of 1\" pine board and plywood (just because I ran out of pine), and the screw is from a bench vise. To attach the plunger head, I drilled and tapped a 1/4\" hole in the end of the screw vise, and bolted it on. After some use, I've found that it's best if you cut the bolt that holds the plunger on so that it bottoms out in the hole, that way you can tighten it without sinking the bolt head or washer into the soft pine board when you start pressing cider. The bucket is a cheap ice cream maker bucket with a small hole drilled in the side and a spigot made out of some hardwood scraps glued on. I sealed all of the parts of the wood that come into contact with the cider with a couple coats of Howard's butcher block conditioner.Eventually, I will upgrade the cheap plywood and pine plunger to a better hardwood one, probably oak, but for now, this one works just fine. When I got ready to start pressing, I quartered the apples and ground them up with a meat grinder, which I must say worked incredibly well. I bought 2 yards of tulle to use as the press cloth; lining the bucket with it, I slopped in several ladle-fulls of the ground up apples and folded the tulle over it, then pressed away. The one main problem with this design I found is that since there is only one hole for the cider to run out through, I had to tip the press as I was tightening it to get all the liquid out.

I think it\u2019s because in the other recipe, we cooked the apples before putting them in the filling, and that helped the apples let its juices out \u2013 therefore making the filling sweeter. In this recipe, we don\u2019t cook the apples. We simply grate them and use them fresh in the recipe which makes for a totally different experience. Also, we didn\u2019t use any regular sugar in this recipe, the only sugar is from pure honey. My mom has a love affair with honey and she loves using it in recipes. But the amount we used in this Szarlotka recipe is very minimal, making this apple pie much less sweet than the traditional (still reduced sugar) one.your hands too much, the crust dough should remain as cold as possible put the crust on the bottom and sides of the round pan (22 cm) Make pin holes along the bottom of the crust with a fork Brush the crust with the reserved egg white For filling Peel the apples and grate them on the large grater side.

They definitely approved of the pictures, and my former-chef bro-in-law gave me some great advice on how to make it like they do in the restaurant. I searched other copycat versions, but those use jarred Alfredo, I'm OK with a lot of food in jars, Alfredo sauce is not one of them. A truly authentic Alfredo is butter and Parmesan, the version many make adds heavy cream. With salt and pepper that's 5 ingredients, not one jar of Alfredo sauce I looked at contains only 5 ingredients, so I'll go ahead and make my own, it's very easy, I promise. Even the Old Chicago menu reads: This Old Chicago exclusive starts with spaghetti tossed in Alfredo sauce made from scratch daily with Parmesan, mozzarella, Romano and provolone cheeses, topped with even more cheeses and slow-baked to toasty perfection. Served by the slice over our house marinara. There are a few steps to this recipe, but they can all be done around, or at the same time, with a little multi-tasking. I will say you can use a good-quality jarred marinara, but the recipe I use, from Cook's Illustrated, can be made in less than an hour, and tastes as if it's been cooking all day. I made a roux-based Alfredo, thick enough to coat the pasta and not separate when baked. Reserving a bit for a creamy top, made slightly gooey with a top layer of cheese. Some of the edges of the spaghetti get slightly crunchy (my favorite bits). With each bite you get rich creamy spaghetti Alfredo brightened up with the marinara. Some garlic bread and a side salad are all you need for a perfect meal. My dad and I really love Arrabbiata, or zesty marinara, sauce, I believe you could use that as a base for some nice heat if you love spicy foods too.

We have extended our patio and added an area for cooking, grilling and smoking - now we have an outdoor kitchen. I always wanted an outdoor cooking area because I love the idea of cooking in out in the open air. Most of the plans for an outdoor kitchen area I was able to find online were made up of wood and steel, and I wanted to try something new. First we drew the plan (as seen in the pictures). We then started with digging the marked area and then poured concrete in there. We then used concrete cinder blocks to build the walls. This was ultimately followed by tiling and grouting. All in all, it took about 3 weeks to finish, considering that we were only able to give this a few hours every day. Items needed: Sand Cement blocks (total number depends on how many and how high do you want the walls) Cement/concrete mix Tiles Mortar Grout A small counter grill, a large gas grill and a smoker Specifics: The digging was followed by mixing the concrete bags - we had to use about 35 of the 80lb bags. We waited for a few days to let the area completely dry.We then put concrete blocks according to the counter space we needed, and to make sure that the smoker and the gas grill fit as well. We also left some space between our back wall and the grill for safety reasons. We then filled up most of the blocks and spaces with cement. After it had dried well, we mixed up the mortar followed by tiling. Finally, we grouted the tiles, and left it for two days.

Cream butter with sugar. That means whip them together until they're well incorporated, fluffy, and much lighter in color. Other ingredients will mix better if the butter and sugar are properly aerated. Beat in the eggs. It'll probably look like you've ruined your dough at first; the fluffy butter and sugar will be goopy and curdled looking. Keep beating it. Eventually the eggs will emulsify and the mixture will become fluffy again. Stir in the flour, salt, and baking powder. I don't bother to \"sift them together\" first like most recipes cry for. Screw that, man. My flour doesn't have lumps. Does yours? Didn't think so. Modern flour mills do wonders for smooth flour. Anyway... Separate the dough into three parts.You'll probably want a couple more bowls for this, unless you feel like spreading raw cookie dough all over your kitchen counters. Add some cocoa powder to one of the portions of dough. I like using two kinds of cocoa powder for color; the extra dark stuff would make it look too gray if it were used alone, so I also add the redder/browner regular cocoa powder. Add some cinnamon to the second portion of dough. I happened to have two kinds in my cupboard, one roasted, so I added both. I stirred in some almond meal for good measure. I need to order more vanilla beans. I've been almost out for awhile... I used tonka bean for this. If you're thinking of freaking out because of coumarin content in tonka beans... here. Read this: http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2010/11/the-tonka-bean-an-ingredient-so-good-it-has-to-be-illegal/65616/ I shaved a little tonka bean into the light colored dough and added a little almond meal to that one, as well. Once each portion of dough is mixed evenly, wrap them in plastic and refrigerate for an hour or so. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F before you leave the kitchen. Step 2: Layer and Bake the Dough. <PIC> You could probably just knead the colors together to marble them... I rolled them out flat, stacked one color of dough on top of the next, then kept rolling the whole thing flat. After I had several thin layers of all the colors of dough in one slab, I sliced them and mashed the slices next to each other in a big flat cookie. Make sure to mash the dough slices onto a piece of parchment. You'll want to bake the cookie on parchment so it's easily removable. Do not use waxed paper or aluminum foil for this. I baked it for about 10-15 minutes at 350 degrees F. You'll want the edges to be barely golden brown, but the center to not be doughy at all. The mountain will collapse if the cookie sections aren't completely cooked. The golden brown edges won't cut very well, though, and might crumble before you can construct the thing.

Use a sharp knife to bevel the inside edges of your cookie pieces. They don't have to be a precise angle; just slice off the corners that would otherwise meet and cause large gaps on the outside surface of the mountain. Beveling the inside edges also allows more contact area of the pieces so they adhere to each other a bit better and make the whole structure more secure. Save those edges that you slice off, though! You'll need them in this step. Melt the chocolate chips in a ziplock bag in the microwave; check it every 20 seconds or so. Knead the chocolate in the bag to make sure it's all smooth and melted. Snip the corner of the bag and use it to pipe a thick worm of chocolate along one of the edges of a cookie section. Did you line up your cookie pieces in order? Crap... you should do that now.

Once you've assembled a decent section of the mountain, you'll probably notice that the thick chocolate seams are pretty noticeable. It's okay, man. Find the thin slices of cookie from beveling the edges. They'll still work if they crumbled a bit. Place the slivers of these over the chocolate seams. The whole thing will look much more balanced now; the seams won't be and shouldn't be completely invisible, but now they'll look like they belong to the whole cookie mountain. I assembled about half the mountain and went to bed; the thing was very secure when I checked it the next day, and I was able to finish putting it together.

Hand rolled for the win, man. Of course, if you can't find makko powder, you might decide to skip this part.

Clove - deeply spicy warm, slightly earthy Ginger - sharp spicy Ambrette Seeds - adds a heady, vaguely musky, sensual, animal note to the blend, usein moderation or it'll make you think someone nearby needs a shower Tonka Bean - adds an intense cherry like sweet thick buttery vanilla-esque quality - use in moderation or it'll feel like you've just sucked down 20 syrupy sweet milkshakes in a row Sweet Frankincense - adds a mysterious (in this blend, anyway) resinous, slightly pine like but brighter than other kinds, sweet citrus note Ambergris - subtle, like a sweeter hay smell mixed with pleasant antique books, wrapped in the smell of warm clean skin from someone near and naked enough to taste, but before anything has happened yet Mix the spices with the makko powder.

{"chunk_id": "40870_8", "text": "<PIC> There are to parts to this: the treasure and the dirt/snow on the mountain. You will need: white chocolate dark chocolate some leftover cookie crumbs a spray bottle of water edible luster powder (gold for the treasure, and I also got some white to add to the powdered sugar snow) food coloring powdered sugar everclear or vodka, I guess... but I wouldn't want the water in the vodka to make things soggy Melt some white chocolate. Mix it with some cookie crumbs... about 1 T cookie crumbs to 2 T white chocolate. Spread it out on foil and freeze it to chill it fast. Crumble it up into little tiny pieces. Mix a little everclear with food coloring. Paint the white chocolate cookie crumb bits with the tinted alcohol. Sprinkle some luster dust on them. Set the treasure crumbles aside to dry for a bit. Melt some more white chocolate. Melt some dark chocolate, too... I'd say about an ounce of each. You can put them both in the same bowl AFTER they're completely melted and stirred; you don't want to mix them to a smooth consistent color. Using a butter knife or finger or whatever you have handy, smear a little dark and white chocolate on the side of the mountain. Scrape it over the sides so some cookie still shows through and the chocolate isn't very thick. Remember to leave the chocolate somewhat unmixed so there's some shade variation. Continue to do this over the entire mountain, making sure not to cover all the beautifully marbled cookie you baked. Spray it with the water. OH NOEZ THE CHOCOLATE SEIZED! That's what you want it to do. Melted chocolate might seem wet, but it doesn't have water in it. Adding just a little water makes it clump and stiffen. It'll also force the chocolate to bloom a bit as it dries (meaning the cocoa butter isn't in stable crystal formation and some of it comes to the surface of the chocolate, making it look chalky and dry). This might look terrible on a candy bar, but it's great for the side of a mountain. Hopefully your spray bottle had a very fine mist setting so there aren't water droplets all over your mountain now. Blot them off if there are.Take a sharp knife and carefully shave some of the excess chocolate from the sides of the mountain here and there, allowing more of the marbled cookie to show through in places. Some parts of your mountain might still look a bit too glossy. Dip a soft paintbrush in cocoa powder, and lightly brush these areas to darken and dull them. Clean your brush and dip it in powdered sugar. Dust the top of the mountain with powdered sugar to give it a snowy look. You'll probably have to touch up the powdered sugar later on, but it's good to add a base coat for now. I used some melted white chocolate to attach the treasure to a small ledge on the mountain. If you didn't build one, you can make one really quick with a sliver of cookie or a glob of chocolate. I know, I know, neither the dwarves nor Smaug would've kept the treasure visible on a ledge. Yes, it's silly... but I couldn't make it work quite right with having a cutaway view of the mountain and a heap of treasure inside. Deal with it. Find an xacto blade or other sharp object to poke a hole above the ledge for the dragon head to come through, especially if you want the cinnamon incense smoke to come out of his mouth. Use the blade to attach the bits of treasure to the white chocolate on the ledge. Add some luster dust to the treasure to make it look sparkly. I decided it looked the best to have mostly yellow treasure coated with gold luster powder, and some random pieces of red, blue, green, and purple treasure to look like gems.

Melt two tablespoons of sugar with one tablespoon of corn syrup, one tablespoon of water, and three drops of red food coloring in a pan. Stir often. Don't use a candy thermometer for this; it's too small an amount. Instead, use a skewer to pick up a bit of the sugar and let it fall.", "images": ["the-lonely-cookie-mountain_7"], "origin_id": 40870}
{"chunk_id": "40870_9", "text": "Once it forms a string that hardens after the sugar falls, it's ready. This isn't as hot as you'd cook sugar for hard candy and lollipops; this is a lazy way to make a clear shape in sugar that doesn't require a heat lamp or specialized training. It still takes patience and some zaps in the microwave, but because we're leaving the sugar a bit softer, it's a little more forgiving and less... shattering. Pour the hot sugar onto some nonstick foil or parchment. Separate two globs to be the wings. Use a skewer to gently poke them into triangle shapes roughly the shape of wings. Pick up one of the globs and gently pull the edges apart - do this SLOWLY like the artisans who make dragon beard candy. If you go fast, the candy will break. The sugar will harden as it cools. When this happens, place it on parchment and microwave it for 5 seconds - no more than that. 7 seconds left mewith a bubbling pool of red sugar on my parchment. If the wing breaks, push the pieces together (they might not stick at first) and microwave another 5 seconds, then squish them together more. I don't know of a solid technique to explain. I just kept heating the wings, fixing what I messed up, pulling, and pinching until they were roughly the shape I wanted. I had some little scissors to cut the edges of the wings, but they kept making them shatter. I tried to keep the sugar thick on the upper part of the wing (which supports the wing and attaches to the dragon back) and pull it thin and clear for the membranes. I pinched a little hook at the angled joint in the wing support. Step 8: Sculpt and Attach Dragon. <PIC> Chop 1/2 ounce of white chocolate and add a teaspoon of corn syrup. Melt them together and stir. Add a drop or two of glycerin if you have it. I didn't measure and used too much corn syrup, so my dragon was a bit soft. Don't laugh. I added some cocoa powder to darken the white chocolate clay before adding red food coloring.", "images": ["the-lonely-cookie-mountain_8"], "origin_id": 40870}
{"chunk_id": "40870_10", "text": "I kept a paper towel handy to blot the excess oil that always seems to ooze from chocolate clay. I first rolled out a couple worms and attached them to the wings. This helped make it easier to attach the wings to the mountain. I rolled two thick snakes for legs. I cut the ends into three sections for toes, then shaped them slightly (see the pictures) with a clay tool and squished them onto the treasure ledge. I lined the hole above the treasure with chocolate clay to make a solid foundation for attaching the dragon wings, then shoved them into place. I then took a chunk of clay, rolled it into an elongated egg shape, and sliced one end to be the dragon mouth. I shoved the round end of a paintbrush into the mouth and through the clay to make sure the dragon head and neck were a hollow passageway (for the incense smoke to pass through later). I left the dragon head on the paintbrush while sculpting it. This was partly because my clay was too soft. For the record, I'd also like to blame the lame shape of the dragon head (too short, not reptile enough) on the too soft clay. I put more information on the notes on these photos; look at them if you need help sculpting your dragon head. I squished the dragon head into place, still using the paintbrush to keep the hollow part open. I then diluted black food coloring with some everclear and painted the dragon head with it. I probably should've diluted it a bit more; it had been my intention for the coloring to mainly sink into the deep areas of the dragon's face, emphasizing the sculpture. I blotted some extra food coloring off with a clean cotton swab. I then dusted the high parts of the dragon with luster powder. I checked the mountain for large cracks that might let incense smoke through, since I wanted most of it to come out of the dragon's mouth. I filled them with chocolate clay, then covered the red clay with melted dark chocolate. I re-dusted the mountain with cocoa powder on the bottom and powdered sugar on the top, just in the areas that had needed the chocolate clay. Step 9: Burn It!.e.

This recipe is for 8 apples. Ingredients: - 8 somewhat tart cooking apples, cored, but not peeled - 1 (14 to 15 ounce) package of refrigerated pie crusts (packed two to a package) - 1/2 cup light brown sugar - 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon - 1/3 cup chopped walnuts - 1/3 cup raisins - 1/3 cup oatmeal (rolled oats) - 8 pats (4 Tablespoons) butter or margarine - ~24 toothpicks Preparation: 1. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. 2. Mix brown sugar, walnuts, raisins, rolled oats, and cinnamon together, in a bowl. 3. Cut both pie crusts into quarters (= 8 pieces).

It\u2019s okay to let excess spill over onto the open pie crust. 4.n a circle, positioned just under the round edge of the oven. Bake for about 35 minutes, checking occasionally. Boy Scout / Trail Life USA Option: Wrap each finished (cored, filled, and with a pat of butter top and bottom) apple with one layer of aluminum foil, shiny side out. Next, wrap again with another layer of aluminum foil, shiny side out. To produce an essential layer of trapped air between the two layers of aluminum foil, wrap the second layer of foil from the opposite side of the foil-wrapped apple, so that the wrinkled, thicker part of the foil wrapping surrounds the entire apple and prevents burned spots. Set the foil-wrapped apples over a bed of hot coals/charcoal, tumbling frequently with tongs, for about 20 to 30 minutes until done. \"Shiny side out\" foil wrapping will make the cooking more of an even-baked and controlled process. When done, remove and discard outer foil layer and serve.

Making very red icing is quite difficult, it is quite important to use very good quality gel food colouring because liquid colouring makes your icing too runny. Also, if you're using butter cream icing, it helps to use white food colouring first to make the yellow icing white before turning it red otherwise you end up with peach instead. When it comes to making black icing, the easiest way to obtain a true black without turning it bitter (which happens when adding too much food colouring) is to first add cocoa to your icing and make it chocolate. Once your icing is dark brown, add your black food colouring and it will quickly turn black.

I also love sweeter tomatoes in this - I tend to use grape or cherry. :) Make sure you're using a white onion - yellow onions are too mild and sweet.Method: Dice the onion finely. Pierce the tomatoes with a sharp knife and squeeze out the seeds and excess juice. Chop the tomatoes so they match the size of the onions. Mince your garlic and pepper of choice.Place everything in a bowl and mix in a generous pinch of salt. Add lemon juice and chopped cilantro to taste. Keep tasting and add until you love it! I never add any crazy additional spices to mine - it's good as-is! I use lemon here instead of lime because I think the pico is sweet enough thanks to the tomatoes. The lemon adds a nice sour/sharp note. :) Just use whichever citrus you like more! Also keep in mind that while it's best made in advance, the salt we added will cause lots of liquid to come out of the tomatoes and onions.

It makes a great treat, snack, or even part of a meal. I like to make it in order to take with me when I go hiking or to be eaten as a snack as I drive home from work. My method of making Jerky is a very simple. It uses the basis of Biltong, which is an African dish that is preserved game meat. I made a few changes to this traditional meal to make it into a jerky.Preserving food is a skill which has been forgotten by many in our modern world. Learning and perfecting the process of storing meat is a great skill for any person seeking self-sufficiency. Whether you live in the country or in the city you should be able to find space to practice making Biltong, gaining confidence in knowing that you can store meat for later consumption. Biltong is a method of curing strips of meat in order to preserve what is available at a time of abundance, for use when meat is not available. The type of meat extends to almost any animal, yet I normally use Beef or game as for me it is so easily available.

If you can't find the Pink salt, go with which ever salt you can find (although I would recommend against a rock type salt. It requires more salt to work, so your food will be very salty).In addition, many types of meat can be used, some people have had great success with Fish, Chicken and Game meats. I usually stick to Beef, yet I know that Kangaroo Biltong is also very tasty. The above list of ingredients is just the basic requirements.

Chilli, Garlic, Brown Sugar and Worcestershire sauce do make for some great modifications to the recipe. I will leave it to you to consider your own tastes and modify accordingly. Step 2: Slicing the Meat. <PIC> Traditionally the meat is cut into strips of around an inch (2.5 cm) in width, making a rectangular prism (or box) shape. I have found that I get much more enjoyment from the biltong when it is cut thinner, perhaps around 25/64 of an inch (1cm). The length of the strip is only limited to the location you intend to dry the meat. I use a meat dryer that I built, so the strip is limited to 9 inches (20 cm). I prefer to remove all fat from the meat while I am preparing the cuts. The fat won\u2019t spoil the biltong, yet in my opinion it can make the taste of the meat less palatable (or waxy) and can also make it tougher.Once the meat is sliced into the appropriate dimensions it is placed into a large bowl and soaked in the vinegar.", "images": ["making-biltong-or-jerky_2"], "origin_id": 40970}

Once you are satisfied with the marinating it is time to add the spices.aten it all. Step 3: Spicing the Meat. <PIC> To prevent wastage and to ensure a proper coating, it is wise to add each ingredient individually. I place the meat on to a work area (for example, a chopping board). I usually start with salt, taking a pinch of salt and evenly spreading over each side of the meat. I have tried several types of salt in this step and I have had the best results with Himalayan Pink Salt. It is very subtle and does a great job of drying the meat without adding too much saltiness. You can easily add too much salt here, so I fiwhich I like (as dry as cardboard). I would recommend trying it daily till the meat has reached a stage which you are satisfied. When the Biltong is ready, remove it from the hangers and store. It can be vacuum packed for longevity, yet I find that it stores fine in a mason jar. I, however, don\u2019t normally worry too much about storage... it tastes so good that it rarely lasts more than a couple of weeks before I have eaten it all.", "images": ["making-biltong-or-jerky_3"], "origin_id": 40970}

Now just collect everything that comes out and put it in to a demi john or some 2 litre bottles, keep going until the distillate starts to come out cloudy, at this point you don't want to keep this stuff for your gin but you can bottle it up and put it in the still with the next time you do a first distillation and claim some of the alcohols back. if your using a spirit hydrometer you should see around 60% ABV coming out of the still doesn't matter if it\u2019s a little less than that, and you should get between 2.5 and 3 litres of this percent. you will also notice if you are testing it as you go along that the ABV slowly drops as you go and then it starts to drop fairly quickly before its starts to become cloudy. when it gets to about 20% abv there's not much point in collecting any more as your just getting too much water so just turn off the boiler and wait a few minutes then turn off the water. wait for the boiler to cool down a bit and discard the contents down the drain. Step 4: The Botanicals. <PIC> this bit is easy enough, you just need to measure out the botanicals and crush them in the pestle and mortar to release the flavours and pop them in the pot you have put aside to hold them all in, you could just use a bowl and put cling film on it when you\u2019re done.", "images": ["making-gin-from-scratch-vapour-infused_4"], "origin_id": 40973}

These will add much more floral aroma, including notes of lavendar and rose. add 2g of grains of paradise again crush them and add them to the mix, adds flavours from a strong peppery bite to light lavender notes add 2 g of Cassia Bark, or if using cinnamon use about 1g of a stick, crush it and add to the mix, you may notice that my jar says cinnamon sticks, it\u2019s not its cassia bark I can see that it is but a lot of places call them cinnamon sticks because it releases a cinnamon flavour. add 2g of Liquorice root powder directly in to the mix add 2g of angelica root and grind this up in the pestle and mortar, this is hard work so just do it for as long as you can be bothered lol. add 0.2g - 0.3g of orris powder, I used some jewellers scales for this but you can see the amount in the cup I used, it is a small amount but it\u2019s important as it binds the flavours together and has adds floral flavours. now your suppose to add 0.2g of lemon rind but I can never be bothered to weigh it out so I have been using unwaxed lemons and just using about half of the surface of it, you can see the amount in the pictures. now this is the bit where I had to get creative, you need Bitter Almonds, in the US and the UK these are listed substance and very hard to get hold of, you could use Bitter Peach Kernels but again some country\u2019s including the UK have these as a listed substance as well. why are both of these listed substances? because they contain cyanide, in our process the cyanide would be destroyed by the heat in the still.but I couldn\u2019t get either of those so I just added some Almond extract which came from bitter almonds and for good measure I threw in some regular almonds as well. Just mix this lot together then pop the lid on and get on with preparing your still. Step 5: Second Distillation. <PIC> With the second fermation you can\u2019t just put the previously distilled spirit directly in the boiler and fire it up, this is dangerous, so what we need to do is make sure there is enough water in the still before we add the vodka/spirit. Fill it up so it\u2019s over the element then wait a little more so there is a little bit of depth above the element. now pour in your spirit and the tails (the end part of a run) from any previous runs of gin or vodka, don\u2019t use the tails from anything else as it could taint the flavour. this is the point where I had to improvise, most distillers make a basket for their botanicals which just slides up in to the column and", "images": ["making-gin-from-scratch-vapour-infused_5"], "origin_id": 40973}
{"chunk_id": "40973_7", "text": "I was no different, I made a basket up using copper mesh and a piece of pipe. However when it came to putting the basket in it wouldn\u2019t fit because of a slight indent at the bottom where the easy flange was formed. as a quick idea I cut a piece of copper mesh that would fit in the column and push the middle in to create a dent so it would sit in the middle of the column. I spooned the botanicals in, gave the side of the column a couple of taps to get the loose bits to fall, then popped in a couple of stainless steel scrubbers in behind it. I had cleaned the scrubbers before this by pouring boiling water over them to remove any oils. using a dowel I pushed down the scrubbers until they stopped sliding, you don\u2019t need to pack them down hard as you want the vapours to get through the botanicals. Pop the column on with a decent gasket and clamped it down using the tri clamp, making sure it was nice and tight, I use a screw driver to make it tight, put the cooler on and make sure its full of water, it doesn\u2019t have to be running at this point.turn the boiler on full power, it will take about an hour to an hour and a half to heat up and the vapour works its way through the column. as soon as you see small drips coming off the output column cut the power to the heater by half and turn on the water for the cooler. you can collect the distillate from the start here, no need to discard the first part as all the bad stuff has been removed on the first distillation. It should be coming off at around 55% or a little more, collect it using the jars at 100ml at a time keep checking the alcohol volume and you will see it slowly getting less and less. Keep checking the colour of the distillate as well, it should always be clear. When the volume starts to drop faster keep an eye on what comes out as soon as you have any signs of it being cloudy stop adding it to the main batch. Keep collecting it though and bottle it separately, you can use this in the next run. Step 6: Bottling. <PIC> Bottling it up, to make it the strength of a proper gin it should be about 40% or 42% if your are making a Bombay Sapphire East style. so you need to water it down, to do this you need to use clean water, not tap water, you can use bottled water or distil water using your still. you can use this calculator work out what amounts you need to add to make up the target amount. http://homedistiller.org/calcs/dilute something I have noticed is that even though both the water and the gin are clear when you add them together for some reason it goes cloudy, not sure why it does this but it does not affect the taste. Don\u2019t forget to label your bottles so you know how much alcohol is in it. Te feed back that I have had from people who have tried it, is that its not far off Bombay Sapphire, and often they have asked me for more ;-)", "images": ["making-gin-from-scratch-vapour-infused_6"], "origin_id": 40973}

I came in 8th! I had a lot of issues and mistakes but I learned a lot and am now planning and starting my next sculpted cake for a show at the end of April. The theme for the Showcake category at That Takes The Cake was Super Heroes and Villains from comics, books, movies and TV. I chose to make Hellboy because I love Mike Mignola's work, as well as the movies and loved Ron Perlmann as Hellboy.

The head and arms are rice cereal treats and the rest is Devil's Food cake (felt that was fitting for Hellboy) covered in fondant and then detailed and hand painted with gel food colors. One of my mistakes was hand painting the skin and base. I hadn't yet learned to use the airbrush I recently bought and was out of time so I hand painted it and it came out really splotchy, with brush marks and was way too wet and shiny for way too long. I would definitely recommend using an airbrush! Although the texture was great for the coat. I also didn't build up the shoulders and I should have, as once the heavy fondant was on they shrunk in. Also didn't use enough support dowels and separators inbetween every few layers so his body started to settle and compress down with the weight of the cake (this is the biggest cake I've ever made, learned a lot!) but his head and top of shoulders were made out of the rice cereal treats and stayed up on the supports, so he eventually came apart, starting even before judging. The 4 hour drive to the show I think hurried the process along. Here's a list of general supplies I used to make the cake: \u2022 Cake pans for baking the cakes. I used a quarter sheet pan for all of the cake. \u2022 General cake decorating supplies: Mixer, spatulas, turn-table, carving/clay/fondant/gumpaste tools, matt to roll fondant on, fondant rolling pin, gel food colors, knife, cake leveler, toothpicks, food-safe paintbrushes, small containers to mix food color \"paints\" in, tape, cake support dowels, etc. \u2022 Ingredients to make cakes, buttercream icing, fondant and to mix food colors with (you will mix the food colorings with something like vodka or clear vanilla extract, not water.) I had to make a wooden base to support such a heavy cake so I've shown that in this Instructable too. I used two 24\" x 24\" x 1/2\" plywood pieces, and a larger wooden dowel and wood screw and then a pack of wooden cabinet knobs as the feet, so that it would be easier to get fingers under the heavy cake and board.Here's the link to the alterations made to a box cake mix to make it a little stronger to better support sculpting. I altered this recipe a little, adding an extra egg and an extra half cup of flour. http://cakecentral.com/recipes/7445/the-original-wasc-cake-recipe Here's the link to how to make the marshmallow fondant, which is pretty yummy, although very sweet! Pre-made fondant can be bought if you do not want to make the marshmallow fondant but beware that some of the pre-made doesn't taste very appetizing. Two brands that do taste good are Satin Ice and Fondx. I've used the Wilton once before and it's not too great tasting. http://www.wilton.com/forums/messageview.cfm?catid=7&threadid=137541&FTVAR_MSGDBTABLE= Here's a simple recipe for the buttercream icing, a 2 lb batch. This uses shortening in place of butter. I'm in Texas and butter doesn't hold up as well. If you don't have a stand mixer or don't want to make your own icing you can buy some pre-made. Ingredients: 2 Cups Shortening 2 lb bag Powdered Cane Sugar (or approx. 8 Cups) 4 TBSP Meringue Powder 2 tsp Vanilla Extract (use clear vanilla if you want your icing to be white) 2 tsp Butter Flavor (use clear flavor if you want your icing to be white) 1 tsp Almond Extract Water Directions: Sift together powdered sugar and meringue powder into large bowl. Set aside. Mix the flavor extracts together in a measuring cup. Add enough water to the mixture to bring the amount to 1/2 a cup. Put this into a mixer bowl with the shortening. Add about 1/4th of the sifted powdered sugar/meringue powder mixture to the shortening and flavors in the mixer bowl. Beat on a slow speed with the paddle beater and the slowly incorporate the rest of the powdered sugar mix into the mixer bowl as it's slowly mixing. Once it's all in there I usually turn it up a notch in speed for about 1 1/2 - 2 minutes.Then it's done! Keep it covered until you are ready to use it, as it will \"crust\" over if you are not ready to use it and leave it uncovered to the air. Step 1: Making the Base. <PIC> To make the base to support such a heavy cake, I used two pieces of 24\" x 24\" x 1\" plywood. I rounded off the edges of both boards, rounding the front edges more. The display table at the show was rounds so I wanted the base to be rounded off. I then glued them together with wood glue and nailed them together. You can see an extra strip I added on the back egde. That was to be for some elements that I had to omit due to time constraints so that can be ignored. :) Once it was together, I sanded it all down. Then I drilled a hole in the center where I wanted my main support dowel to be, the same size as the wood screw shaft, but smaller than the screw head. For this support dowel I chose a 1/2\" dowel, 24\" long since the minimum height for the competition was 24\". I made a small hole in one end with a small drill bit.

Step 2: Covering the Base With Fondant. <PIC> Next I made a large batch of the fondant and covered the base with it. After making the fondant and setting it aside, all wrapped up so it wouldn't dry out, I brushed on a layer of piping gel to the top of the base and sides and about an inch over the edge on the bottom. This gives something for the fondant to stick to. I rolled out the fondant and layered it on the base in several pieces, as I couldn't roll a big enough piece to cover the whole thing in one piece. This was OK though since I was going to cover over the seams where the pieces met. After this was done I rolled out the rest of the fondant and cut random tapering, curving strips and layered them on top of the fondant covered base, radiating out from the center support, mostly in front.

Place coated slices in the hot pan and fry until golden brown on each side. This could about 5 minutes per side depending on the heat your stove produces.

A sheet of hot plastic is is blown in to a bubble and then sucked onto the surface of the form.A vacuum forming table basically is a simple box with some holes on top to create a suction area.

I used a 45 degree miter joint to create my box, but you can use any joinery method for your box.

That always seemed weird yet yummy and tempting. So I decided to make cinnamon rolls with bacon bits and caramel and bacon topping. I found a recipe online and modified it as the following:Ingredients Dough: 1/4-ounce package yeast 1/2 cup warm water 1/2 cup whole milk 1/4 cup sugar 1/3 cup butter 1 teaspoon salt 1 egg 3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour Filling: 1/2 cup melted butter, plus more for pan 3/4 cup brown sugar, plus more for pan 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 3/4 cup crispy bacon chopped Glaze: Caramelized condensed milk and more baconInstructions Glaze Gently boil a can of Condensed milk for 3 1\u20442 hours and set aside to let cool.

Add 2 cups of flour and mix until smooth. Add yeast mixture. Mix in remaining flour until dough is easy to handle.Knead dough on lightly floured surface for 5 to 10 minutes. Place in well-greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled in size, usually 1 to 1 1/2 hours. When doubled in size, punch down dough. Roll out on a floured surface into a 15 by 9-inch rectangle. Spread melted butter all over dough. Mix sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle over buttered dough. Sprinkle with bacon bits. Beginning at the 15-inch side, roll up dough and pinch edge together to seal.

You can buy many different shapes for chocolates, but for something truly unique, you need your own special design, maybe even many special chocolate mold designs. We used ComposiMold - FC, (which stands for Food Contact) because we liked the reusability of the product. Simply choose the toy, ornament, craft, or any small object and make a mold using ComposiMold. Pour the melted ComposiMold over the selected item, and let cool. You may have to use a polymer clay or tape to prevent the object from floating in the mold material. After the mold has cooled, remove the toy from the mold, and you are ready to pour the chocolate! Chocolate can usually be melted in the microwave (depending on the chocolate)... Use short time intervals, and stir the chocolate frequently to make sure it gets melted. Chocolate into your Molds Once the chocolate is melted, pour it into your unique chocolate mold using a spoon, stick, or brush to fill the mold. Tap the bottom and sides to get air bubbles out of the chocolate. This will leave little holes in the chocolate if you don\u2019t. You may like using a squeeze bottle to push the chocolate into small openings and crevices.Cool the chocolate in the mold by placing in the refrigerator or freezer. Peel the mold away from the chocolate as much as possible so you do not put a lot of pressure on the chocolate. Now you can eat your toys!

In this instructable, I will show you how to make Corn Tortillas with three ingredients and gluten free. A full instruction and downloadable recipe can be found on The Tortilla Channel.The tortilla is the base of the Mexican kitchen but also an egg dish in the Spanish kitchen. I have found that just about any culture has it\u2019s own tortilla. That is why you can\u2019t go wrong with a \u201ctortilla\u201d.I always used store bought tortillas thinking it would be either to difficult or take to much time to make them from scratch. Until I found how easy it is to make my own corn tortillas. Ok they may not look the same as store bought ones or taste the same (they taste better in my opinion). The best part is you can use them as a base for other recipes think tacos or tortilla chips. Step 1: What Do You Need to Make This Recipe. <PIC> For corn tortillas you have to use special corn flour which is called Masa Harina. You should not confuse it with polenta flour or cornstarch. Masa Harina can be white or yellow. I bought the white variety but the yellow is even nicer with the happy color.

Either lay them apart or press just before you put the tortilla in a hot pan. Step 2: Instructions. <PIC> Put the 2 cups of Masa Harina in a bowl. Add the salt to the bowl and stir thoroughly.

Every time my family of four fought over who ate how many, which means loss to the restaurant because the way to end the fight is to make it at home, so everyone can have as many as we want without overspending on dining.After searching, I found Noodles and Company has actually published its recipe here. However, when I followed the recipe exactly for the first try, the flavor and texture of the meatballs were far from the restaurant's, the taste of sauce is not well at all. I have made many, many more times of the meatball after the first try to get as close as possible to the restaurant's because as far as flavor and texture and the taste of the sauce are concerned, my family all want nothing to be different from the restaurant's.In a summary, I add a few things and spices to the meat batter of the published recipe by Noodles and Company to make its flavor the same as the restaurant's.

This is what you need: - 3 kg plums - 1 kg sugar - clean jarsFirst step: is to wash the plums really really good.Second step: you have to peel them off (if the skin doesn't go off easily you can put them into boiling water for less than a minute and take them out and peel them:P - be cautious not to get burnt). I had no need to boil them because with these plums you can take off the skin really easy and pretty fast. Cut the plums and remove the pits.Third step: put the plums into the heavy bottomed pan and pour the sugar on top of it. On a low fire you have to mix the fruits and the sugar with the wooden spoon until the sugar melts.After that you have to turn the fire on and boil the jam, stirring with the wooden spoon. Be cautious because it can splash you and it's really hot. It can take up to two hours until it's ready. I know it;s ready when i can see the buttom of the pan while i stir with the wooden spoon.

I expect a quality espresso machine to last at least 10 years and probably more if it's properly maintained. I probably would have spent up to $2-3k if I thought the machine was worth it. I ended up spending about $1,200 for the espresso machine and grinder.There are too many espresso machines to choose from and it's hard to figure out which is the best one.

Not for me thanks.The best espresso machine for your moneyThrough my hours of research on forums, reviews, in store investigations, this is what I bought. RANCILIO SILVIA w/ COMPUTER TEMP (PID)The Silvia is a great machine and the most popular. It's in the ~$600 price range without a temp. control modification. The temperature control is an custom modification to control the temperature of the water. Without the temp. control, the boiler can fluctuate ~40 degrees. You typically need to spend $2000+ for temperature control in an espresso machine, but you can get the Sylvia for less than half of that. You can also buy kits to do this yourself and there are a number of instructions on how to do this, just google Silvia PID.Now you'll need a grinderI thought I could get away without buying a grinder, but I was wrong, very wrong.You'll need a burr grinder that you can adjust to match your coffee beans. I'll explain this more in the next step, but trust me, don't skimp on the grinder or you'll never be happy with your results. Step 2: Pulling Shots. <PIC> So you've got the gear, let's get started.Turn your machine on and let it warm upThe better the machine, the longer it takes to warm up. Make sure the handle is attached to the unit while it's warming up. You want all the brass to be nice and warm. The Silvia takes about 20 minutes to warm up. Also remember to make sure there is some water in the steam wand by turning it on and letting water run through it. You don't want heating components to be dry as they will get damaged over time.

I also use the hot water to heat up my mugs before pulling the shots.Load up your espresso handle with coffeeLevel off any excess coffee before we get to tamping. Here's another item you'll need, a nice tamper. This is what you use to compress the coffee in the espresso handle basket. The Silvia uses a 58mm size tamper. When tamping, use about 30lbs of pressure. If you need a sense of how much pressure that is, try using a bathroom scale and pushing against it. Tap the sides to get any air bubbles out and then finish with a light twisting off motion.Insert espresso handle and start pullingMake sure the handle is properly locked into your machine before hitting any buttons. This is the area you'll need to work on the most. It is supposed to take around 25-30 seconds to pull one ounce of espresso from start to finish. If it comes out too fast, you need a finer grind. If it's too slow, you may need a coarser grind or you may be tamping too hard. If you don't have a good coffee grinder, you may not be able to get the right grind for your machine. Different types of coffees will need different grind settings.Before pulling, you also want to know the temperature of the water. Again, some coffees do better with different temperatures and even 1-2 degrees can make a difference. I'm using 219 degrees right now. You'll just need to experiment and if your machine does not have a temperature control, you can probably find somebody who has 'temp. surfed' it enough to know how to get the appropriate temp.

If you've been frustrated by less-than-stellar stir-fry results at home, simple velveting will take your stir-fry from mundane to extraordinary. Your family will swear it's take-out. ;-) Here's how it's done with chicken:Ingredients: 1 lb boneless, skinless Chicken meat, cut into thin strips 2 teaspoons Rice Wine (Saki) or Seasoned Rice Vinegar 1 large egg white 1 Tablespoon cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 Tablespoons Canola or Peanut Oil- divided WaterTools: Medium bowl Whisk Colander large skillet Slotted spoon Preparation: Whisk the egg white, cornstarch, rice wine, salt and 1 Tablespoon of oil in a medium bowl until smooth. Add the sliced chicken and stir until coated. Refrigerate (marinate) 30 minutes. Drain in colander. Add 1-2 inches of water plus 1 Tablespoon oil to the skillet. Bring to a full boil over high heat.Reduce the heat to medium-low. Immediately add chicken strips, individually, to the almost-boiling water. Stir with slotted spoon so they don't stick together. Once the water comes back to a barely-bubbling simmer, cook the chicken strips for 1 minute longer, stirring occasionally. After 1 minute, remove the chicken with a slotted spoon into the colander to fully drain. Put the drained strips into bowl and cover with plastic wrap. The chicken strips are warm, fully cooked and ready to be added to your favorite stir-fry. Need a delicious Stir-fry recipe? Try one of my favorites: Black Pepper-Garlic Chicken.

Activated charcoal has many health benefits including: preventing hangovers, whitening teeth, anti-aging, and removing toxins from the body. It works by bonding to toxins which get carried out of the body through elimination. (There is a much more scientific explanation of how this works in the link above.)*Please note that I am not a doctor so do your homework before taking activated charcoal for yourself!

Minor mistakes when making large quantities don\u2019t show, mess up with two pounds of dough and everyone knows. Hence I urge you all to acquaint yourselves with the local Italian bakery or at least the fresh Italian bread dough from your market, dough is the hardest to make in small batches, unless you have the skills or a machine, go to the bakery or market. Every recipe I have ever read or used has been incomplete, process steps are always left out and equipment is never mentioned. I approached the search for homemade pizza like a science experiment and have refined the ingredients and each step in the process. This may be tuned to my oven and baking material, yours may vary slightly (especially cooking times check the progress if you must but remember it will add baking time).

If the dough retracts (and it will) by pulling in, it is time to let it rest. Too much handling will cause it to be elastic it will never stretch out to the edges. Before resting for the first time place plastic wrap over each pizza taking care to have it extend over the edge (if you let air in it will start to dry out and that area will be have a very thick crust yuk). Step 3: A Proper Resting Place:. <PIC> To rest as stated in the last step place plastic wrap over the dough covering the pan, place the pans on an elevated wire rack.

As stated above, place them in a preheated oven at 375F, for 18 min (check for browning after 15 min to see how your oven works after you figure out your oven this is unnecessary, establish a swapping time and stick to it). Note: there must be ample room around the pans to allow airflow or the bottom one will burn and the top won\u2019t cook. After 18 min swap the positions of the pizzas (top to bottom, bottom to top) bake for an additional 18 min. Take this time to prepare toppings (I like fresh baby portabella mushroom, peperoncini peppers, pepperoni and cheese). After 18 min take both pizzas out of the oven and place them on the stove (remember who was on top, it matters) the bottom should be starting to brown. About apply toppings; remember the cheese is always last, this keeps the pepperoni from cupping and rendering fat. So it\u2019s pepperoni / meat, fungi, vegetables then cheese. I find that 8oz of cheese is enough to do both pizzas. Place the garnished pizzas back in the oven for 8-10 min remember to remember to swap positions.After the 8 min check the pizzas (use the oven window if you can) one may the done before the other (toppings melted not burnt), if it is not brown enough for your taste leave in for up to 3 more min. Even if it is a little pale it should still be crispy. Don\u2019t let the topping burn. Note if you like your pizza well down add time equally between two bake cycles before you apply the topping. As I stated, over cooking the pizza with the toppings will cause the fat in the cheese to come out and make it very greasy. Step 7: Slicing. <PIC> One would think this would obvious but I take it to the extreme again. After you take the pizzas out of the oven, use a plastic spatula (like you use to flip pancakes) around the edges if necessary and use it to help slide them onto a cutting board one at a time. It should slide out given a liberal use of olive oil. Use a pizza cutter to slice each pizza into 12 pieces (3 columns x 4 rows). Takea paper towel and run it around the empty pan to get any extra oil. Then lift the cutting board (mine is light about 3/8 inch thick and about 12in x 20 in) slide the pieces back into their pans to serve. This is done using a single sliding motion where you use hold it over the pan at an angle and slide the cutting board from the rear of the pan to the front (with the cutting board at about a 20-degree angle) simultaneously using the spatula or hand to push the pizza back into the baking pan. Use the spatula to cut the cheese between the slices seperate (so no one gets shorted on toppings), serve. If all is done right the pieces should be about 1\u20442 to 3\u20444 inches thick, crispy on the bottom and it won\u2019t go limp when you pick it up.In conclusion (finally, what a wind bag):Who else but an engineer would have gone this far.", "images": ["sicilian-pizza-developed-using-the-scientific-met_7"], "origin_id": 41432}

Using electric mixer (see note on previous step under \"Hardware\") beat pumpkin, sugar, and oil in large bowl. I happen to have hazelnut oil, so I substituted about a 1/4 cup of it for some of the vegetable oil - should add a subtle flavor without changing the cake structure. Feel free to experiment, just don't change the total amount of oil. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating to incorporate between additions. Here the recipe called for 2 tsps of orange peel. Bleah. I skipped that and added some lemon peel instead. Your cat will be supervising, so make sure no fur gets in the food. Ugh. Add flour mixture and beat on low speed just enough to blend it.You want a light cake and beating the devil out of it will increase gluten production making for a more, ah, tough chewy cake.

Cool the cakes in pans for 10 minutes or so, then flip them out (nice to have a cooling rack for this) and turn them top side up to cool completely.During the cooking time, you may realize the can of pumpkin filling you purchased was overly large. Since you have excess, you should utilize it by attempting the pumpkin torte again. Hey! By the time the cakes are done, you can toss it into the oven preheated to the same cooking temperature.

Sprinkle 1/2 cup powdered sugar over the bottom of a small skillet, cooking on medium heat until sugar melts. No need to stir yet, but I'm serious about the medium heat. Don't burn the sugar with impatience. Once melted, you can stir as needed, watching for a color change to amber - a coupla minutes. Now, stir in 1/2 cup cream, vanilla, and salt. (Useful to already have this mess mixed and ready to pour). The goo is going to bubble like a witches cauldron. Whee! Stir some more, dissolving any hard bits. Stir in that last teaspoon of cream, and let cool to room temperature in a small bowl. You have just made candy.On to the next. Using the electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter in a large bowl. Gradually beat in powdered sugar. How much? Well....I went off the recipe because I started with a big container of powdered sugar instead of a 1# box.

Products(for 4): 1 small bowl of basmatti rice (~200 g) 100 g pitted black olives two large (~700g) aubergines 4-5 average tomatoes 1 large onion 6-7 cloves of garlic a handful of fresh parsley 4 tbsp olive oil 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 1 pinch cinnamon+1 coriander grounded black pepper, paprika salt (for the aubergines) Cut the aubergines in large thin circles, salt them and put aside. Chop the onion in tiny cubicles, heat 3 tbsp of the olive oil in a pot, put in the spices stir, add the onions and stir again. Let in simmer for a minute and add the rice. Stir wee until all of it takes the bright yellow colour of the turmeric, pour in two small bowls of water, cover and lower the heat. Cut the olives in circles and add them to the boiling rice.In about 10 minutes remove from the stove and leave it to absorb the remaining liquid. Rinse the aubergines from the salt and steam them for 5 minutes until soft. Cut the garlic in slices. Pour the remaining oil in a pan and cover the surface with it. Lay one layer of aubergines (approx. half of the entire quantity), put some pepper, paprika and half of the garlic slices. Now cover evenly with the rice and put the rest of the aubergines on top. Add pepper/paprika and the remaining garlic. Cut the tomatoes on circles and arrange on top as last layer. In one of the corners of the pan pour half bowl of water. Cook in 180C (356F) degrees for about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with the minced parsley on top. More Easy Vegan Recipes!", "images": ["easy-vegan-recipe-for-paella-with-aubergines_0"], "origin_id": 41444}

I've been sick the past couple of days and it was one of the only things that sounded good. :) This salsa is best with fresh corn, but it works well with frozen corn too! Just pop it in the microwave to defrost or leave it overnight in the fridge. Ingredients: 1 1/2 - 2 cups fresh or defrosted corn 1/4 red onion 1 jalapeno or serrano pepper 1/2 tomato or a few cherry or grape tomatoes (if tomatoes are out of season, the smaller ones will taste better!) 1-2 limes salt chili powder cilantro Method: Dice the onion, tomatoes and jalapenos and dump into a big bowl with the corn (I like to scoop out the excess seeds and liquid from the tomatoes, but you don't have to!) Add a pinch of salt, a pinch of chili powder and the juice of one lime. Taste and add more lime and salt as needed! You will want to use lots of salt. I normally put in two big pinches, which always seems like far too much but works perfectly. You do need quite a lot to balance out the sweetness of the corn.Same with lime juice - you'll use more than you think! It's never more than two limes, though. Keep in mind that this is best eaten right away - the salt will pull water out of the veg and make it runny after a while. :) ", "images": ["corn-salsa_0"], "origin_id": 41450}

The following is one of the easiest and tastiest I have found.Nasturtium tropaeolum majus is a most useful plant to grow in any garden not just for decoration or wildlife habitat but because the leaves, flowers and seeds are all edible. They will also grow in poor soil, in containers and as they can be found in both bush and climbing varieties, are eminently suitable for urban or limited space, square foot and vertical gardening.Here I am using them as an alternative to nori and making home-grown sushi wraps.TOP PHOTOGRAPHFor a more elaborate traditional sushi, I wrap the rice in extra large nasturtium leaves. I don't have a rolling mat but just use eco baking paper. I can then cut them into lengths just as I would with nori. You can also use other leafy vegetables such as cabbage, kale or spinach but the younger and more pliable leaves are easier to manage.", "images": ["organic-seaweedless-sushi-making-your-own-home-gro_0"], "origin_id": 41470}

{"chunk_id": "41486_1", "text": "Introduction: Chicken Sinigang. <PIC> A pretty popular Filipino soup, Sinigang is a sour, savory soup that can be made with beef, pork, chicken, or fish. I use chicken in my soup because I like the lemon-chicken flavor combo. If you were to try fish, I would recommend a white fish over a salmon. I steer away from using red meat in this soup because I don't immediately associate beef or pork with something very tart and sour. This recipe, like so many of the ones I use, is flexible. I build my recipes mainly on feel, taste patterns, and smell. If things smell 'right' together, I use them together. That's how I decide on vegetables and spices. Sometimes I ask my mom what she puts in each recipe, and then if I know I can't get a certain item, I ask what my substitute options are., and add the chicken when the daikon slices start to turn a little transparent. The very last thing you add is the spinach, so it doesn't overcook. Wait until the chicken is finished cooking in the broth, and then toss in several handfuls of spinach. Let those simmer for a minute or two, keep stirring, and then you are ready to serve! If you have steamed Jasmine Rice, make some! I love to add a spoonful or two of rice to the bottom of my bowl before dishing up the Sinigang. It's just the way I always ate it growing up. I love making this dish for my Filipino friends, because it reminds us all of good, Filipino food. Just like mom always made it.", "images": ["chicken-sinigang_0"], "origin_id": 41486}
