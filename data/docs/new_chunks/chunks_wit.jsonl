When mediation came to nought, Alexander III evidently orchestrated an invasion into the Isles as means to openly challenge his Norwegian counterpart's authority. Specifically, the thirteenth-century H\u00e1konar saga H\u00e1konarsonar indicates that Kermac aided William I, Earl of Ross during this action, and staotland a prosperous and accomplished man, and was later commissioned by Alexander II, King of Scotland to construct Eilean Donan Castle. According to the mediaeval chronicler Matthew Paris, Hugh de Ch\u00e2tillon, Count of Saint-Pol commissioned the construction of a great ship at Inverness in preparation for the Seventh Crusade. Although it is unknown whether Kermac was indeed a sea-going participant in this crusade led by Louis IX, King of France, some Scottish noblemen certainly did accompany the king on the campaign.

To date, the discontinuous operation of Kanichee Mine has produced 4.2 million pounds of metal. <PIC> The Kanichee area is associated with an igneous intrusion that has been termed the Kanichee layered intrusive complex. This roughly oval-shaped intrusive complex is part of a volcanic belt characterized by felsic and mafic metavolcanic rocks called the Temagami Greenstone Belt. Kanichee is one of the three most notable mines in the volcanic belt, others include the Sherman Mine in Chambers and Strathy townships and the Copperfields Mine on Temagami Island in Lake Temagami.every magmatic series was developed by magma of similar composition. A lens-shaped area of quartz gabbro remains directly south of the main portion of the intrusive complex. However, it is not clear whether it has a separate magmatic origin from the olivine gabbros found in the Kanichee layered intrusive complex. The ore zone rocks from the first magmatic series clearly have connections with adjacent metavolcanic rocks of the Temagami greenstone belt. The future of the Kanichee Mine remains uncertain, as all mines in the Temagami area continue to be abandoned. The last mine to operate in the Temagami area was the iron bearing Sherman Mine until its closing in 1990 and Kanichee's discontinuous history of mining and exploring throughout the 20th century has left the area abandoned for decades. However, a geologic project is expected to be evaluated for potential sampling at new Kanichee deposits in 2009, sparking a possibility for renewed mining operations. Other samplings associated with this project include new deposits or occurrences in the Golden Chalice, McWatters and Langmuir areas. ", "images": ["2_372"], "origin_id": 20372}

An entirely different family of proteins, the innexins, forms gap junctions in invertebrates. Each gap junction is composed of two hemichannels, or connexons, which consist of homo- or heterohexameric arrays of connexins, and the connexon in one plasma membrane docks end-to-end with a connexon in the membrane of a closely opposed cell. The hemichannel is made of six connexin subunits, each of which consist of four transmembrane segments. Gap junctions are essential for many physiological processes, such as the coordinated depolarization of cardiac muscle, proper embryonic development, and the conducted response in microvasculature. Connexins also have non-channel dependant functions relating to cytoskeleton and cell migration.

Created in 1980, the Gay Liberation sculpture by American artist George Segal was the first piece of public art dedicated to gay rights and solidarity for LGBTQ individuals, while simultaneously commemorating the ongoing struggles of the community. The monument was dedicated on June 23, 1992, as part of the dedication of the Stonewall National Monument as a whole. <PIC> It is located directly across from the Stonewall Inn, at the northern end of Christopher Park, along Christopher Street in the West Village section of Manhattan, New York. The sculpture depicts two pairs of life-like, life-size, affectionate couples made of bronze and painted white. One couple (two men) are standing, and the other (two women) are seated. It was originally commissioned in 1979 (the 10th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising) by the Mildred Andrews Fund, a Cleveland-based foundation that supports public art displays. The commission specified that the work must be installed on public land and that it \"had to be loving and caring, and show the affection that is the hallmark of gay people.... And it had to have equal representation of men and women\".viewer to appreciate the intimacy of the partners' relationships. Christopher Park is directly across from the Stonewall Inn, and has been at the center of the Gay liberation movement of New York City since before the Stonewall Riots of 1969, as it was already a gathering place for homeless gay street kids who slept there. In 1999, the Stonewall bar and the surrounding neighborhood streets, including Christopher Park, were placed on the New York State Register of Historic Places and added to the National Register. When Segal was first approached about the possibility of commissioning Gay Liberation, he was uncertain about accepting the undertaking, and his initial reaction was that the sculpture should be done by a gay artist. He eventually decided that he would accept the project in the name of empathy and respect to the community, saying, \"I'm extremely sympathetic to the problems that gay people have. They're human beings first. I couldn't refuse to do it.\" Nonetheless, some have argued that Segal should not have taken the job. Responding to this criticism, Segal jokingly acknowledged himself as \"an unregenerate heterosexual\", but said that his heterosexuality \"did not prevent him from having an insight into the natures of his gay friends.\" ", "images": ["2_726"], "origin_id": 20726}

Venantius subsequently replaced Saint Ansovinus as the city's patron saint.In 1259, during the destruction and sacking of Camerino by the troops of Manfred of Sicily, the relics of Venantius were transported to safety to the Castel dell'Ovo at Naples.

In addition to the slightly larger caliber, Italian ordnance designers introduced a spitzer -type bullet for the new cartridge, with the tip filled with aluminum to produce an unstable (tumbling) projectile upon impact with soft tissue (a design most likely copied from the.303 British Mk VII bullet).

Although modest in elevation, topographic relief is significant as the summit rises one vertical mile above the bay and Resurrection River in four miles (6.4 km). The mountain's toponym was officially adopted in 1983 by the United States Board on Geographic Names to honor Alice Lowell Scheffler (1879\u20131965), the daughter of Franklin G. Lowell, who with his family were the first homesteaders to settle the Seward area in 1883. Alice was the daughter of Mary Lowell ( Mount Mary ) and sister to Eva ( Mount Eva ).

The NRHP listing included two contributing buildings on 4 acres (1.6 ha). <PIC> In the 1920s and 1930s, Forest Service employees often traveled many miles from local ranger stations to forest work sites. Since the forest road networks were not well developed, getting to a job site meant a long trek, carrying all the equipment needed to perform the fieldwork. This made it impractical for employees to make daily round trips. To facilitate work at remote sites, the Forest Service built guard stations at strategic locations throughout the forest to house fire patrols and project crews.After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most National Forest areas within a few hours. As a result, guard stations lost their utility. The Forest Service found new uses for some stations, but most were demolished or abandoned.In the 1990s, historic preservation groups, with the support of Forest Service employees, began pressing National Forest managers to preserve the remaining structures. To finance the preservation effort, the Forest Service started renting its guard stations to the public. It later began renting out many unused fire lookout towers as well.
