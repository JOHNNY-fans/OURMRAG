{"id": "RECIPE_1", "question": "What are the essential steps to create a giant Kinder egg filled with surprises for kids?", "provenance": [40001], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Project GIANT Kinder Egg. <PIC> A bit late for Easter but better late than never.....This is an Instructable my sister and I came up with doing as a surprise for my nephew and a bit of funAs the title gives it away, it was the idea originally was to build a hugh easter egg but a kinder twist to put a bigger toy in, sadly this did not go totally to plan but still had a good result.Be warned this is a MESSY task And I should add, Please be sure to check any allergy conditions for anyone consuming the egg if they are allurgic to latex with the balloon. Step 1: You Will Need..... <PIC> Firstly we headed to the shops where we purchased; 6 x 200g bars white chocolate (any chocolate will do really)7 x 200g bars milk chocolate 1 x packet of 12\" balloons ( pearlised white suitable for helium but not for children under 3 ) 9 x kinder eggs ( 3 for photographic purposes, 6 for research and consumption ) 1 x 6\" string ideally new and unused for hygiene Step 2: Inner Layer............ <PIC> After much trial and error and searching on the web for ideas we found an article where some was using various balloons to make various weird and wonderful chocolate egg shapes. We had decided by this stage that this balloon technique was the best way to go to achieve the egg shape.We attempted filling several from the multipack with the following; expanding foam (expensive, smelly, ruins your clothing, damages the lawn and doesn't work)...........sand, flour, sugar, beans from child's beanbag (very sensual but again doesn't work)Having exhausted all of the above we decided to take a calculated risk and allow the chocolate to cool more thoroughly before dribbling over air inflated balloon.So........We started by suspended a balloon from kitchen cupboards with string.Melted some while chocolate over the hob ( in the microwave or any method for melting chocolate will be fine BUT be warned there is a risk of burning or be cautious!!!) Then we let it stand for a couple of minutes to thicken, when thicker and still runny consistency, slowly and gradually built up layers of white chocolate using the dribbling method and left to cool and harden. Step 3: Outer Layer. <PIC> With the white chocolate now hardened we repeated process with the brown milk chocolate. The dribbling process was less satisfying with the brown chocolate and we found it went a bit gloopy as it dribbled from the top to the bottom. We attempted to smooth manually as best as possible with a spatula which kind of worked lol.Once finished leave to dry or put in the fridge to fully harden Step 4: Almost There. <PIC> After a couple of hours and a lot of cleaning lol with a lot of caution the air filled confection was taken out of the fridge and set down carefully on the cupboard top. Following the explosion/implosion of our first effort the egg was approached with caution and the protruding rubber of the balloon pierced very slightly to allow a slow and steady release of the air. And then the balloon was easy to remove from the top of the egg.  At this point my sister decided to cut the egg in half using a heated knife, much to my protest but it seemed to work, so if you do this method be very very careful!!! Step 5: Finishing Details. <PIC> With the egg complete....pretty muchI decided to use my standard printer and laptop to blow up a kinder egg wrapper design i found onlineThen once printed lay it over some silver foil and stick together using tape. ( not my best work but was pushed for time as first attempt failedThen we just \"layed the egg\" (forgive the punn) in a basket placed the wrapped around and waited for the kids to distroy it lolHope you all like and vote in the comp, we added a real kinder egg in one of the pics for  scaleEnjoy Step 6: .

My SprawlMart often sells rotisserie chickens, various flavors, 2-1/4 lb each, for $4.00. At that price it is hardly worth buying raw chicken, preparing and cooking it at home. Roasted chicken tends to get dry when it is reheated, though, even in the microwave. I have solved that problem.\nTo see my related Instructables, click on \"unclesam\" just below the title above or in the INFO box to the right. On the new page that appears, repeatedly click \"NEXT\" to see all of them.\nUnclesam Step 1: Cut Up Chicken and Bag Portions for Freezing. <PIC> Needed (also from SprawlMart) in addition to precooked chicken: Quart-size ziptop freezer bags; Uncle Ben's pre-cooked rice, Roasted Chicken flavor; Swanson's low-sodium Chicken Broth (NOT stock).\nI buy several chickens, use poultry shears to cut out the backbones, eat those together for one meal fresh. I cut the remainder of each chicken in half along the breastbone, remove each leg and thigh, connected, as one portion. I leave the wings in place, but cut each breast crosswise to make each into two portions, the smaller having the wing attached, the larger not. I am trying to eat more fruit and vegetables these days, so each of the six portions is plenty for a meal for me. I freeze each portion in a one-quart freezer zip bag. Step 2: Thaw Portion and Reheat. <PIC> When I want to have chicken, I put a portion in the fridge to thaw overnight. At mealtime, into the bag I pour a few tablespoons of Uncle Ben's pre-cooked rice (the Roasted Chicken Flavor is the only one also sold in large, economy-size bag; knead out the lumps before opening; precooked rice will not increase in volume). Then I pour in a few tablespoons of Swanson's Chicken Broth (NOT stock), reduced sodium version, which was chosen as best tasting in \"America's Test Kitchen\" (PBS TV show) tests. I zip the bag closed, leaving a little bit unzipped to allow steam to escape. Step 3: Prop Bag Up to Prevent Spills. <PIC> Bag needs to be set up so that it cannot fall over and spill out liquid during reheating. If I am also going to heat up some precooked vegetables, I put them in microwave-proof tubs, loosely covered. It works better for certain side dishes to first microwave just the sides for a minute on highest power, then add the plate and chicken, microwave all for 3 minutes on high, follow with 4 minutes at half power. I store portions of sides in the fridge in these plastic containers, eat the reheated sides directly from the containers. Step 4: Hot, Juicy, Tender, Yummy!. <PIC> Unzip the hot bag and carefully dump the contents onto plate. The extra liquid will be absorbed by the chicken as it is cut up for eating, will help keep it moist. The rice is healthy side dish, also helps hold the moisture.\nU.S.", "images_list": ["chicken-reheated-juicy-and-tender_0", "chicken-reheated-juicy-and-tender_1", "chicken-reheated-juicy-and-tender_2", "chicken-reheated-juicy-and-tender_3", "chicken-reheated-juicy-and-tender_4"]}

{"id": "RECIPE_14", "question": "What\u2019s the best way to prepare a delicious homemade spicy eggplant pizza from scratch?", "provenance": [40012], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Homemade Spicy Eggplant Pizza. <PIC> \nAs summer is nearing its transition into the cooler days of fall, it is the best time to make up something a little spicy using great seasonal vegetables and flavors. This is one of my favorite dishes to make on a cooler afternoon after a trip to the farmer's market, or to my garden. This pizza really highlights the earthiness of the eggplant, and kicks it out of its natural blandness with a dose of garlic and chili oil.\u00a0 Enjoy! Step 1: What You'll Need:. <PIC> For the pizza dough:\n- 1 1/2 c. hot water (as hot as you can run it from the tap, NOT BOILING or you will kill the yeast)\n- 1 1/2 tsp. dry active yeast\n- 1 tbsp. olive oil\n- 1 tbsp. salt\n- 1 tbsp. sugar\n- 3 c. all-purpose flour\n- oil for greasing the bowl\nFor the eggplant topping:\n- 1 large eggplant\n- olive oil for brushing\n- 3/4 c. grated mozzarella\n- 1/4 c. grated parmesan\n- 2 tbsp. olive oil\n- 2 tbsp. minced garlic\n- 2 fresh chilies, minced (I use red thai chilies - if you prefer less heat, use less intense chilies like jalapeno) Step 2: Making the Pizza Dough. <PIC> (IMPORTANT NOTE: this dough recipe is good for TWO pizzas, so if you want two eggplant pizzas, just double the amount of eggplant topping ingredients, OR\u00a0 you could top that second pizza margherita-style by hopping over to my companion instructable, Homemade Pizza Margherita)\nThis dough recipe is one that I have had since I was in grade 8 Home Economics class, and it has never failed. It makes great pizzas every time, and can also be used for tasty calzones, or even an easy focaccia.\n1. Sprinkle the yeast over the top of the hot water. Use the hottest water that you can run from your kitchen tap. DO NOT use boiling water or you will kill the yeast, and your dough will not rise. Let the yeast \"bloom\" for 5 minutes.\n2. Add the olive oil, sugar and salt to the yeast, and stir.\n3. Measure the flour into a large bowl. Add the yeast mixture to the flour and, using a wooden spoon, stir until well combined. The dough will appear VERY gooey - this is normal, as it makes a much more tender dough. DO NOT add more flour to the dough during this step.\n4. Brush or spray some oil over the sides of the bowl and the top of the dough. Flip the ball of dough over and oil the other side. This will help when removing the dough after rising.\n5. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel, and set in a warm location to rise for 1 hour. Looking for a warm location? Try above the fridge, above you cabinets, or on the stove as you're preheating the oven for the next step! Step 3: Preparing the Toppings. <PIC> Onto the good stuff - this is where you can easily diverge from the recipe and top your pizza however you want, but I STRONGLY suggesting spicy eggplants. If, however, you choose to go your own way, skip ahead to the next step for directions for how to bake the pizza.\n1. Slice up the eggplant into 1/3-inch slices and spread them onto an aluminum foil-lined baking pan brushed with oil. Brush the tops of the eggplant slices with oil also. Broil the eggplants until lightly browned, then turn them over and broil them the same way on the other side. Set them aside for now.\n2. In a small frying pan, heat the 2 tbsp. of oil over medium high heat. Add the minced garlic and chilies, and swirl the pan for about a minute. You don't want to saut\u00e9 them, just heat them and infuse the oil with all that garlicky-chili flavor. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside for now.\n3. Mix the mozzarella and parmesan cheeses together in a bowl. Now you are ready to garnish your pizza! Step 4: Topping and Baking Your Pizza. <PIC> 1. Preheat the oven to 500 F. Set one rack in the lowest position in your oven. If you have a pizza stone, place it on the rack before you preheat, so that it can heat to the same temperature as the oven. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can just as easily bake the pizza on a baking sheet. A pizza stone is a good investment, however, as it makes for a nice crisp outside and tender inside to your pizza crust. I highly recommend it.\n2. Generously flour a section of counter or a silpat* mat. This a really important step. The dough is very sticky, and this is when you will be adding in enough flour to make it workable, but not so much as to make it tough. So flour the counter well, and the rolling pin, and the top of the dough. Roll out half the pizza dough for one pizza, to 3/4-inch thick. You can make it round, or square, or free form in shape - I haven't found that either one tastes better than the other, but I've always like the rustic look of the free form pizza. (*A silpat mat in a silicone baking mat that can be laid over your counter before flouring. It will make transferring the dough to the pizza stone easier, and make cleaning up a cinch. If you don't have one, but ARE baking on a pizza stone, transfer your dough to a floured, reverse baking sheet, so you can then slide the dough onto the stone once it is topped.)\n3. Now for the toppings: First sprinkle about 1/4 of the cheese mixture over the dough. This will help the rest of the toppings adhere to the crust once baked. Lay the eggplant slices over the crust, leaving a 3/4-inch edge for holding, and overlapping the slices where necessary. Top with the remaining cheese mixture. Finally,\u00a0 drizzle the garlic-chili oil, garlic and chili included, over the top of the cheese. Make sure to drizzle it lightly and evenly over the entire pizza, or you will end up with pockets of heat - unless, of course, that is what you are going for!\n4. If you floured your surface really well, this part should\u00a0 will be easy. However, I have made this pizza\u00a0 half a dozen times, and this step has not gotten any easier. Using the help of a large spatula, slide the pizza off the counter and onto your baking sheet, or if you are using a stone, off the silpat or reversed baking sheet and onto the stone. Don't worry about squishing and smushing the pizza as you move it, you can adjust its size slightly once in the oven. Be careful not to burn yourself on the pizza stone - it is currently at 500 F! Close the oven and bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes, depending on how brown you like your crust, and how hot your oven runs. Remember - no two ovens are the same. Step 5: Yum!. <PIC> Oooh, this is the best part. Once that timer rings, remove the pizza from the oven, either on its baking sheet or using a pair of tongs to slide it off the stone and onto a cutting board. Turn off the oven.\nBask in the awesomeness of a spicy, garlicky, cheesy eggplant plant pizza, with its tender-crisp homemade crust - oh yum.\nGrab your pizza wheel and slice into that bad boy - and enjoy.\nRemember, there's still enough dough left for a second pizza, so you always recreate this one, or hop on over to my recipe for Homemade Pizza Margherita and try that one out too. The two topping combinations compliment each other nicely.", "images_list": ["homemade-spicy-eggplant-pizza_0", "homemade-spicy-eggplant-pizza_1", "homemade-spicy-eggplant-pizza_2", "homemade-spicy-eggplant-pizza_3", "homemade-spicy-eggplant-pizza_4", "homemade-spicy-eggplant-pizza_5"]}

I have been tinkering around with this for a while, and I have found a really good way to make a refrigerator cheesecake out of only three things:1 bag of double stuf Oreos 2 8 oz blocks of cream cheese 1 Pint of Heavy Whipping Cream Step 1: Watch the Video!. If you like to learn how to do things through videos, check out this one I made showing step-by-step instructions on how to make this cheesecake! Step 2: Make the Crust. <PIC> First, get a medium and a small bowl. It can be a bit tedious to separate the oreo fillings, but I find putting them in the fridge for 5 minutes and using a butter knife helps. Place the cookies in the larger bowl and the fillings in the smaller bowl.Next, use the bottom of a heavy cup of a food processor to smash the cookies into small bits. The smaller you get, the more solid your final crust will be.Normally we would add melted butter to this before blind baking, but in the spirit of using only 3 ingredients, we can substitute the butter by adding in 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream into the crumbs. Mix it in well and then place the crumbs into the bottom of a spring form pie tin. I like to use the same heavy glass I used earlier to compact the crumbs slightly.Place this into a 350 degree F oven for 7-9 minutes, or until your apartment smells like oreos. Step 3: Make the Filling. <PIC> Place the oreo creams we separated earlier into your smallest pot over low to medium low heat. We want to melt them down as much as possible.In a large mixing bowl. place both packages of cream cheese. I find that letting them sit out for about 20-30 minutes before working with them makes them easier to work with.Using a hand mixer, beat the cream cheese for about 30 seconds, or until it lightens a bit. Slowly pour in the rest of the heavy whipping cream while mixing continuously.Finally, plop in the melted oreo middles and mix until combined Step 4: Assembly and Refridgeration. <PIC> With the filling assembled and the crust blind-baked, it's time to add one to the other! I like to use a spatula and a turn table to create a nice gentle swirl pattern on top.Park in your fridge for 3-5 hours, or until the middle has set up until a firm but soft mass of goodness.To get it out of the springform pan, I like to place the pan on something narrow, like a bowl. The cheesecake should separate cleanly from the sides of the pan.Cut and serve to a grateful world!If you like my recipes, I'd love for you to checkout my youtube channel.

You freeze them, of course! They are great base for any smoothie, and many other things.Its sounds pretty trivial though, right? If you want to freeze something, just throw it into the freezer, and you're done, right? Well, if you put whole bananas into your freezer, they will become rock hard and pretty hard to use in smoothies and other things, and if you didn't even peel it first, well... then you're going to have a hard time.So the trick is to freeze them individually. Its pretty easy! Step 1: Chop Your Banana(s). <PIC> Peel your bananas and chop it up into slices. In theory, the thinner the better, if you want it to be able to thaw easily, but if you got a lot of bananas, don't stress too much about it. Just make them about a cm thick or so. Step 2: Bagging. <PIC> This is the most important part. You could just throw all of them in a freezing bag and throw that into the freezer, but they will all stick together and freeze in solid lumps, and you have the same problem as if you just freezed the entire banana itself, and then you might as well not have bothered cutting them to begin with.Get a big freezing bag and place each banana piece next to each other, sliced side facing up. Don't have any laying on top of one another, only side by side.Once you're done, carefully slide the bag on top of a cutting board (or place it on a cutting board to begin with, if you aren't using said cutting board for chopping bananas, that is..) so they have something to rest on, once you put them into the freezer. Don't bother being able to close the bag just yet. The bag needs to be as flat as possible, for all the pieces not laying on top of one another.My bag was a bit longer than the cutting board, so I carefully flipped the rest of it on top of the rest. You can fold the bag if necessary, just as long as the banana pieces aren't touching each other, and there is plastic in between those layers. Step 3: Break Apart. <PIC> It takes a few hours for them to freeze properly.Once its done, you can take them out and break them from each other so they can be shook together in the bag, so you can close the bag.

I have had some successes (Really good ones) and some not so good ones. This is one of the not so good ones.\nI hate Swedish Fish. Really really hate them. Rather lick a hedgehog than eat a Swedish Fish...But I have a friend who is nuts about them. In honor of her (Her name is Gazelle), I made the Gazelle Swedish Fish Cordial. This was inspired by the \"Shoot The Rainbow\" instructable-Which actually tastes good.\u00a0\nIf you know someone who loves these candy nightmares, make them a bottle. They may think you are the coolest.\nOr they might curse you to your grave for having concocted such a nightmare.\nFirst up...The stuff you need. Step 1: The Nightmare Begins. Here's the Stuff.. <PIC> \u00a0First you need a bag of the little red fruity fish of satan.\nThen a 1 quart jar (With lid)\nTwo cups of cheap vodka\nA strainer\nCoffee Filters\nA large bowl or pitcher\nA bottle that can be sealed.\nYou will need all of this eventually. Right away, you need the vodka, a jar and the fish.\nDo I really need to mention that everything should be clean?\nReally? Step 2: Mix It Up and Wait. <PIC> Put the fish into the jar and pour the vodka on top.\nPut the top on tightly and slosh it around gently, then store in a cool dry place for a week.\nI should have put mine in a closet. I had to stare at it every day as it mocked me with it's horribleness. Step 3: Get Rid of the Chunks.. <PIC> \u00a0After waiting for a week, put the strainer over a bowl or pitcher (I prefer a pitcher- It makes transfering the liquid easier) and pour the liquid through it, followed by the nasty decaying leftover chunks of Swedish Fish. Ok, they are not really decaying. It is the left over gummy stuff with all of the flavor and color washed out. I suppose you could eat one if you wanted, the flavor and color replaced by vodka, but I wouldn't.\nYou want to, don't you?\nGo ahead, I dare you.\nBleaugh.\nMine got dumped down the disposal. Step 4: Filtering Out the Filler. <PIC> \u00a0Remember that cloudiness that\u00a0occurred\u00a0when we first poured the vodka over the fish? The stuff that made that cloud is still in there. We need to get rid of it.\u00a0\nPour the liquid from the pitcher or bowl back into the jar. Rinse the bits of dead fish candy from the strainer and put a coffee filter into it. Restrain the liquid from the jar back into the pitcher through the coffee filter. It will probably take two or more filters. The gunk still left in the vodka tends to slow the stream down to a drip very quickly. Step 5: Make It Go Away.. <PIC> \u00a0Last step. Just bottle it up so that it looks pretty and give it away to someone that appreciates the special nastiness of Swedish Fish. Like my unusual friend Gazelle. I think she'll love it.\nI did try a sip.

The sky is the limit. There are so many molds to choose from online,at stores like Target,Michaels and cake supply stores.

Please check out my other instructables.\n         Step 1: All You Need Is a Few Things. <PIC> sugar\nwater\nmold of your choiceOptional items:\nedible air brush paint\nroyal icing\nluster dust\nfood gel coloring\nheck you could probably even acrylic paint\u00a0 or spray paint if you want to use it as a non edible decoration. Step 2: Preparing the Sugar. <PIC> \u00a0I have seen recipes that call for sugar, water, and cream of tarter. But you dont need the cream of tarter.I never use it. Save it for something else. All you have to do is pour the desired amount of sugar that you want to use into a bowl and add a little bit of water at a time. Mix really well and when the sugar feels like slightly damp sand and when you squeeze the sugar in your hand and open it and the sugar holds the shape of your fist being closed on it, you are ready to mold it.\nIf you want to dye your sugar before you mold it, add the food coloring in at the same time as you add the water. you will see little dark spots of color so mix real well or just make sure that those spots arent going to be seen on the mold.\u00a0 Step 3: Mold the Sugar. <PIC> Grab your desired mold and start putting some sugar in it. Pack it in all over. Fill it about half way, then really push down to get it packed really tightly. Now add more, fill it to the top of the mold. Pack tightly. Make sure that the level of the sugar is flat with the top of the mold so that when you unmold it ,it doesnt \"fall\" a little and break. If it does break at this point just stuff it back in and try again.\nPlace a plate or cardboard or something flat against the sugar/mold then flip it over and now you can see the shape of your sugar mold. Let dry for at least 5 hours.I suggest overnight just to be on the safe side. Step 4: Decorate As Desired. <PIC> You can...\nAirbrush it with edible airbrush paint\nCover it with frosting or royal icing and add lots of details\nUse luster dust to give it soft colors (this method doesnt produce bold colors)\nPiping gel and Wilton decorating icing in a tube also do good for small details.\nOr maybe you already died the sugar before you molded it\nI hope you have as much fun decorating with this method as much as\u00a0I have.", "images_list": ["sugar-molds-for-cupcakes-and-decorations_0", "sugar-molds-for-cupcakes-and-decorations_1", "sugar-molds-for-cupcakes-and-decorations_2", "sugar-molds-for-cupcakes-and-decorations_3", "sugar-molds-for-cupcakes-and-decorations_4"]}

Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> This is meant to be a SNACK and therefore is simple. You need 4 things.1:Chicken. I used split breast meat to meet my diet.2: Bacon. I like Gwaltney's. Tasty and you can buy it in big packs! 3: Favorite Spice. I like Webers... All flavors. But this time I'm using Weber's Garlic Jalapeno! 4: Buffalo ranch sauce. It's tasty, Moore's is good.

Sprinkle a good coating of your chosen seasoning all over both sides of your chicken pieces, then wrap them up wit 2 pieces of bacon. That's about 1.25 oz of chicken and 2 strips of bacon.

Cook with a lid over them so the chicken remains tender,Flip 1/3 of the way for the first time after about 5-7 minutes on low-med heat.  Don't drool in the skillet, It smells awesome! The bacon will be nice and crisp without  over cooking if you keep the lid on. Rotate another 1/3 after about 4 minutes.  After close to 10 minutes of cooking (Maybe 15) Cut your strips in half to ensure the chicken has cooked completely. If the chicken is done, cut each half in half again to make inch long chunks. Lay each chunk open (bare chicken) side up and drizzle buffalo sauce over them!   Looks good and tastes great too!

How to make Coconut Milk and Coconut Chips - PART 3/3Many people confuse coconut water with coconut milk. Coconut milk is water combined and blended with the coconut meat. Coconut milk is higher in healthy fats, protein, fiber, and calories but it\u2019s also like a meal as opposed to a drink. With a young coconut it\u2019s very simple, just pour out the coconut water into a blender and with a spoon, dig out all the meat, put it in a blender and here you have it. It is a great sweet drink on it\u2019s own that\u2019s very healthy and you can add a teaspoon of raw cacao to it, or fruit like strawberries or blue berries, blend them up as well. By itself it has a think consistency such as skim milk. For a more typical coconut milk you can open a mature coconut as I show you in part 2, heat it up for 15 minutes, which separates the meat from the shell and then chop it up into small pieces and put this in a food processor or blender with about 2 cups of pure water until this is finely graded.Then you put this in a nut milk bag, I like to use hemp or cotton ones which unlike nylon, which is terrible for us and the environment. You can get those bags here:This one is better than any coconut milk you\u2019ll find in stores and I highly recommend this for cereal, curries, coffee and anything you would use dairy for and I make kefir with it so you can see my video on that. And the left over meat is great for smoothies, homemade ice cream, yogurt, and salads or to just snack on since it\u2019s very healthy. A cup of coconut water is about 45 calories and a cup of coconut milk is more than 10 times that (552) because it\u2019s more like a mealThe reason these have become so popular is because there are so many benefits. It\u2019s been shown to help with   Weight loss, reducing cellulite, and to stop premature      aging   Lowered blood pressure & cholesterol   Boosted energy & athletic performance  Relax muscle tension  Its great to put on your skin either topically and good for      your skin when you drink it.   Helps with acid reflux  Helps with a hangover by replacing electrolytes and good      for headaches  Anti-inflammatory and reduces plaque formation in arteries to      lower heart attach and strokes.And since it\u2019s very low allergic I highly recommend it. If you do buy this in stores look for cans that are BPA free.BPA is found in some aluminum cans and has the potential to cause many health problems.Because of additives, BPA in the can, and pasteurization, this is the only brand of coconut milk I like: And this is the only coconut water: COCONUT CHIPS: Now to make coconut chips all you do is take the meat from the mature coconut and put them through a typical cheese grader to make small pieces out of them.Ingredients: - 1 Cup shredded or graded raw coconut- 1 tablespoon of maple syrup - \u00bc teaspoon of pink salt Bake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit stirring them up every 5 minutes.

(or eat it!)  Making Shrikhand the proper way takes hours, but do it my way and it'll be ready in less than 5 minutes!Here's what you'll need:   Electric Mixer/Bowl     Packet of MTR Badam Feast (100g)  $2.99     Container of whipped cream cheese (8oz) $1.87But first, the backstory...I first enjoyed Shrikhand in London over a dozen years ago, in one of those great Indian Bhel Poori restaurants on Drummond Street behind Euston Station.  (I'm not sure which one; it might have been the Diwana?)I then emigrated to the USA and any time I was in an Indian restaurant I asked for Shrikhand, but for all the years I've been here I never found it anywhere.  So I decided to make my own...  I followed many Indian recipes but never got the flavor or the texture right.  Recipes called for yoghurt, and I tried plain, I tried Greek, I made my own - but it was never right.  And I tried flavoring with cardamon but never got the flavor right either.Then years later, an Indian store opened in our town, and among the things I tried there was a packet  of flavoring called \"MTR Badam Feast\", intended for milk drinks and desserts. Well blow me over - it was the exact flavor I remembered for Shrikhand.  All I needed to do now was work on the texture, which to my recollection had been far less like yoghurt and more like butter, or ... maybe ... cream cheese?  Well, why not? ... I tried it, with the Badam Feast, and could not believe that I had stumbled on the perfect recipe at last. Given it was some years since I had it, this was exactly  the treat I remembered! (By coincidence, I had to return to London later that year, and I stopped off at Drummond St to check my recollection.  Yes, it was spot on!  This quick & easy substitute really is a good copy of the style of Shrikhand they serve in London...)So... how to make it?  Could not be simpler.  Read on... Step 1: Empty the Cream Cheese Into the Mixing Bowl. <PIC> Empty the cream cheese into the mixing bowl... I used whipped cream cheese - you don't have to, you can use the regular kind and just whip it more in stage 3... Step 2: Add Half a Packet of MTR Badam Feast. <PIC> Add MTR Badam Feast to taste.\u00a0 I find half a packet to a tub of cream cheese is just about right for my taste. Step 3: Mix. <PIC> Give it a good mixing.\u00a0 All the dry powdery Badam Feast should be absorbed. Step 4: Put Back Into Cheese Container and Wait. <PIC> Put the mixture back into the cheese container and wait.\u00a0 We do this to give some of the ingredients in the Badam Feast \u00a0(such as the sugar) a\u00a0few minutes\u00a0to dissolve better, which makes the final product a little smoother. Step 5: Serve & Eat!. <PIC> The quantity we made should serve 4 to 6 people.\u00a0 Serve in\u00a0a small round bowl - the one in the picture is actually way too large - you should pick one that lets you serve a smaller portion and which you can level flat with a knife across the top.\u00a0 Unfortunately I don't have anything like that so I'm pigging out here on about a third of the mixture :-) If you are a restauranteur, you could sell this for about $3 per serving, at a cost to you of about 50 cents, almost no effort, and ingredients you can keep on hand for some time without spoiling!", "images_list": ["5-minute-indian-dessert-shrikhand_0", "5-minute-indian-dessert-shrikhand_1", "5-minute-indian-dessert-shrikhand_2", "5-minute-indian-dessert-shrikhand_3", "5-minute-indian-dessert-shrikhand_4", "5-minute-indian-dessert-shrikhand_5"]}

For the upcoming holidays when family and friends will be arriving, why not surprise them with your own unique cupcake bouquet.

This bouquet has a little wifi note card that the guest can use for the password access in case you don't want it displaying in your home. It will surely make them feel special upon arrival.  Step 1: Your Supplies. <PIC> I used a clear vase for this (about medium size) that was just sitting around :) Next I decided to use the jumbo kabob sticks for poking a hole through the bottom of them and holding them up. I then decided for my icing that I'd do some playful designs just by cutting the corner of a plastic bag an squeezing it out that way :) For my cupcakes, I made the carrot cake from scratch and the cream cheese (cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar), but you feel free to use whatever recipe you want as well as box mixes! Step 2: Putting It All Together. <PIC> This is so quick and easy! For the base I simple broke off a couple of inches on the bottom of my kabobs so the sticks would be shorter and the first 6 cupcakes would form the base around my vase rim.Next, I left the original size kabobs unbroken and placed 4 more cupcakes in between the others so they would be taller. Now, for the little wifi note, I simply took a notecard and folded it in half and poked a kabob stick through the top middle; and let that kabob go through the center of the other cupcakes (see 3rd picture). Note: You can adjust cupcakes as you go or the placement of the kabob stick underneath the cupcake depending on the direction you want it to go.  Step 3: The Finished Product!. <PIC> As the finishing touch, I simply wrapped some ribbon around the vase that I got from Walmart (it was like a dollar I think). We decided to give this one to a friend, so to wrap it up I put some toothpicks on the top of each cupcake and used some flex and seal wrap:) Hope you have fun making yours the next time you make cupcakes!", "images_list": ["cupcake-bouquet-wifi-password_0", "cupcake-bouquet-wifi-password_1", "cupcake-bouquet-wifi-password_2", "cupcake-bouquet-wifi-password_3"]}

A jam syrup underneath a chocolate glaze keeps this cake moist for days. I made it into single-serving sized Bundt and mini loaf cakes but feel free to make one large one in a 12-cup Bundt pan.\nThis recipe might seem complicated, but if you stay organized it's very easy, give it a try! Step 1: Gather Ingredients; Prepare Pan(s). <PIC> You'll need:\n3 cups (15 ounces) all-purpose flour\n1 tsp. salt\n1 tsp. baking powder\n1/2 tsp. baking soda\n3/4 cup buttermilk, room temperature\n1 Tbsp. vanilla extract\n1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice\n2 1/4 sticks unsalted butter, softened\n2 cups (14 ounces) granulated sugar\n3 large eggs, room temperature\n1 large egg yolk, room temperature\n1/3 cup chocolate syrup, such as Hershey's\n2 Tbsp. Dutch-processed cocoa powder\n1/2 cup strawberry jam\n3 drops red food coloring\n1 recipe chocolate glaze\nFor my mini cakes I used one 6-portion mini Bundt pan, and one 8-portion mini loaf pan (batter only filled half, or 4, mini loaves), you can also use one 12-cup Bundt pan. Grease and flour pan thoroughly, I used a baking spray that contains flour.\nAdjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Step 2: Make Cake Batters. <PIC> Whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a medium bowl.\nIn a small bowl, whisk the buttermilk, vanilla, and lemon juice together.\nIn a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer (I used my stand mixer) on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 6 minutes. Beat in the eggs and the egg yolk, one at a time, until combined, about 1 minute.\nReduce the mixer speed to low and beat in one-third of the flour mixture, followed by half of the buttermilk mixture. Repeat with half of the remaining flour mixture and the remaining buttermilk mixture. Beat in the remaining flour mixture until just incorporated, scraping down the bowl as necessary during mixing.\nDivide the batter evenly among three bowls (as you can see, my batter weighed just over 3 lbs. 3 oz. so I put 1 lb. each into the other 2 bowls to account for any batter bits stuck in the bowl or on the scraper).\nWhisk the chocolate syrup and cocoa together, then stir into one of the bowls of batter unti combined.\nStir 1/4 cup of the strawberry jam (I used homemade for this) and the red food coloring into another bowl of batter until combined. Step 3: Divide Batter and Bake. <PIC> Scrape the plain batter into the prepared pan(s), followed by the strawberry batter, then the chocolate batter (in that order).\nWipe any drops of batter off the sides of the pan(s) and gently tap the pan(s) on the counter to settle the batter. Bake the cake(s) until a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 50 to 60 minutes, rotating the pan(s) halfway through baking.\nMy mini cakes baked in 35-40 minutes. (I filled\u00a0my mini\u00a0Bundt pan\u00a0slighty fuller than I should have, you want them about 2/3 full. If you end up with\u00a0larger bottoms\u00a0like I did, just trim the edges\u00a0when you take them out of the pan--the scraps are the chef's treat!)\nLet the cake(s) cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then flip out onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 2 hours.  Step 4: Make and Apply Glaze. <PIC> Once cooled, set the cakes on a couple sheets of wax paper. If you are making one large cake, move cake to cake stand or storage container, slide strips of wax or parchment paper a couple inches underneath cake to catch any excess glaze, remove before serving.\nYou'll need:\nremaining 1/4 cup strawberry jam (instead of my chunky homemade jam, I used Smucker's seedless strawberry jam to get a smooth consistency)\nWarm the jam in a saucepan over medium heat until pourable, about 1 minute (I microwaved\u00a0jam\u00a0in a microwave-safe dish, about 30 seconds on medium). Brush it over the top and sides of the cake(s).\n4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted (I melted my\u00a0chocolate in about\u00a03, 30-second increments on medium heat in my microwave, stirring after every 30 seconds, be careful not to let it burn)\n1/3 cup heavy cream, hot\n2 Tbsp. light corn syrup\n1/4 tsp. vanilla extract\nPinch salt\nWhisk all of the glaze ingredients together in a medium bowl until smooth and let sit until thickened, about 25 minutes.

These jumbo taco cones are easy to make and so much fun! They will definitely add excitement to your next Taco Tuesday! You Need:8-in flour tortillas toothpicks aluminum foil 1lb ground beef 1 package taco seasoning lettuce tomatoes shredded cheese sour cream other toppings as desired Step 1: Form the Cones. <PIC> Gently fold one side of a tortilla half way across. Take the other side of the tortilla and wrap it over the first flap to form a cone shape. You want to get the tip as tight as possible. If there is a small hole in the bottom, Don't worry! It will still be ok.Take a toothpick and gently push it through the overlapping edges to hold the cone together. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Step 2: Bake the Cones. <PIC> Take small sheets of aluminum foil and loosely crumble them into balls. You will need one ball for each cone. Gently insert the ball into the opening in the cone to help it hold it's shape during the baking process.Lay the cones fold side up on a sheet pan and bake for 5 minutes at 400 degrees F. Flip the cones over and bake an additional 3 minutes. Step 3: Prep the Toppings. <PIC> Prepare what ever toppings you plan to put in your cone. I prepped lettuce, tomatoes, and of course: taco meat.Shred some lettuce and dice up some tomatoes.Brown your meat and drain off the fat. Add your packet of taco seasoning and finish with the instructions on the pouch. Step 4: Finish the Cones. <PIC> Once the cones have cooled, carefully remove the toothpicks and aluminum balls. Start stuffing your cone with fillings. I started with a base layer of lettuce to catch anything that might want to fall through the small hole at the tip.

{"id": "RECIPE_106", "question": "What are the best techniques for achieving perfectly thin slices of raw beef for various dishes?", "provenance": [40072], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Tips for Thinly Slicing Raw Beef. <PIC> Whether you want somewhat thin slices for grilled beef skewers, or paper thin slices for carpaccio, slicing raw beef thinly and evenly can be difficult. There are a couple of tips for doing this safely and simply without a motorized meat slicer that will save you aggravation - and finger tips.For the purposes of this Instructable, I chose a cut of meat notoriously difficult to slice thinly, an oddly shaped bottom round roast. There are cuts of beef that are much easier to slice thinly, such as a London broil, but I wanted to show how even the most difficult cuts can be sliced this way.Ingredients:A big hunk of beefGear:A proper slicing knife (description to follow) Step 1: The Right Tool for the Right Job. <PIC> The first tip is to use a proper meat slicing knife. Not only will it make the process easier, but also safer. Using the wrong knife can lead to injury. For example, a thick, sharply pointed chef's knife can catch when slicing raw meat thinly, causing you to lose control of the blade, and a loss of control is an injury waiting to happen. The right knife for the job is a granton slicer. Pictured is the one I own, a Henckels 10\". I won't kid you, this is an expensive knife, I paid over $100 for mine. However, if I had it to do over again, I would have paid $58 for a Victorinox Fibrox 14\" which was recently rated #1 by America's Test Kitchen.So why does the knife matter? Well, grantons, those little ovals in the blade, break up resistance against the blade, allowing for smoother cuts with more control. In addition, a good slicing knife has a rounded tip, so that it is less likely to poke into the meat and catch, producing jagged cuts and putting your fingers at risk. It should also have a gently tapered thickness and flexible blade, this increases control, making thin cuts easier, and safer.  Step 2: Chill the Beef. <PIC> It helps if the meat is a little stiffer than raw, but we don't want to try to cut frozen meat, this will just dull our blade and drive us to conniption fits. I take a fresh, raw, roast and put it in the freezer for 2 hours. Thinner cuts, like a London broil or a vacio, can be placed in the freezer for about an hour. This will chill our beef, making it stiffer, but without freezing it.Take the meat out of the freezer, and using your slicer and a cutting board, cut slices to the desired thinness using a smooth, even motion. It is okay if you have to use a sawing motion (with my 10\" knife I have to do this a lot more often than if I had a 14\" blade), it is okay, just keep it smooth and gentle. Only apply as much pressure as is needed to let the knife do it's job. Follow these tips and you will soon be a thin-slicing pro.", "images_list": ["tips-for-thinly-slicing-raw-beef_0", "tips-for-thinly-slicing-raw-beef_1", "tips-for-thinly-slicing-raw-beef_2"]}

Commonly used in desserts like pies, crumbles and tarts, the Bramley apple is the most important cooking apple in England and Wales. The traditional 'Apple Pie' has been going since 1381! Eaten hot or cold, this classic British and popular dessert can be served with custard or ice-cream.  If you have ever cooked with these dessert apples, you will know that preparing them are extremely simple and mostly cooked this way. You start off by peeling and coring the apple, followed by slicing them and adding lemon juice to stop them from browning. Finally, you add sugar. Depending on which recipe you make, I would add cinnamon to my apples for my Apple Pie. (Also raisins or sultanas would be included in this recipe however in our family we prefer without).Here is my take on this recipe. Simple, quick and ready to serve:You will need an apple pie dish tin, or a quiche tin will do.Pastry ingredients: 250g plain flour 2 tsps of caster sugar 100g of butter (softened) 3-4 tbs of cold waterApple Pie Filling: 2 large Bramley Apples (can use 3 if you like it packed!) (Peeled, cored & sliced). 150g soft brown sugar 2 tsps of cinnamon 1 tsp of nutmeg Juice of half a lemonTo finish: Milk or Egg White glaze.To make this simple pastry I used my mixer, however by hand is just as good. Firstly, sift your plain flour and salt. Add your sugar until everything is mixed well. Once you weighed out your butter, gently with your fingertips rub into your flour mixture. Mix well until the butter resembles fine breadcrumbs. Carefully (so you do not over do it), add your cold water to the dry ingredients. Keep adding the water until the mixture has formed into a smooth dough ball. Finally, wrap into greaseproof paper or cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes.For the apple pie filling, as I explained earlier it is very simple. Peel, core and slice your apples into a mixing bowl. Followed by your sugar and spices and squeeze of lemon juice to stop the apples from turning brown. Let is rest until the pastry is ready to come out of the fridge.When your pastry is ready, divide them into two. One for the top, one for the bottom of your pie. The best part about apple pie is that really, there aren't too many rules how you decorate the topping! On a floured work surface, roll out your bottom part of the pie, simply place into your tin. Add your apples and spread them around the base of the tin. When your happy, roll out the top part of the pastry and place on top of the apples. You can crimp the edges together or fold over the bottom and top together to create a ribbon effect. This will seal the pastry completely. Finally with a brush, add milk on the top to give the pie some colour or egg whites work just as well. I like to cut 2 holes in the middle of my apple pie to let the steam come out, these apples cook really well in the oven and it's important you let them some air to cook! If you feel you have more dough left over, make some leaves or maybe a message on top as an additional take or maybe to impress someone!Bake in the oven at 200 degrees for 15 minutes, then 180 for 20 minutes. Rest for 5 minutes before serving. You can serve this with custard or anything you'd like. We sometimes use Greek yoghurt on the side, delicious! Also served cold is really lovely, maybe bring it along to a picnic in the park! Enjoy!", "images_list": ["old-english-apple-pie_0"]}

I was surprised I made some that looked exactly like the ones in the supermarkets. I used a recipe for laminated dough which makes this croissant has its many layers.

As I got older I started making my own variations with different ingredients and for different occasions. I started making my own partly due to the outrageous prices at candy stores and partly because, making fudge is easy. The addition of bourbon gives this fudge an almost indescribable rich flavor. This fudge is so tasty, it doesn't matter if you like bourbon or not (and I don't), I can't keep my hands off it. Fudge is a little treat for dessert, to bring to a party, or to give as gifts. Now, due to the short cooking time and the addition of bourbon, I recommend using your own discretion when potentially serving this to anyone under 21. Maybe just to be safe, don't. Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> 3 cups of sugar1 stick unsalted butter (chopped)1/4 tsp sea salt1/4+ cup bourbon (to taste)1 can evaporated milk (5oz)8-12oz marshmallows (or marshmallow cream)1 tsp vanilla extract (or bourbon vanilla extract if you have it)1 bag semi-sweet chocolate chips1/2-3/4 cup chopped pecans (toasted lightly at 350 if you prefer) Step 2: The First 6. <PIC> To a large pot, add the butter, salt, sugar, evaporated milk, bourbon and marshmallows. Cook over low-med heat, stirring regularly to prevent burning. Once everything is melted and well incorporated, allow the mixture to come to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes. One of the most important things in this step is to be sure the sugar is completely melted. The number 1 problem I experience with fudge is not letting it cook long enough. Your end result will be grainy and gross if the sugar isn't melted.  Step 3: The Last 3. <PIC> After 5 minutes of boiling, pour the chocolate chips and vanilla into the pot and remove from heat. Stir quickly to ensure the chocolate melts completely. Once the chocolate is incorporated, pour in your pecans and stir.

Seriously??\nThis started out as an idea I had, and it took a lot of trial and error to get these to perfection. Now I can't get my boyfriend to stop begging for them every night! They are delicious and cute and everything you could ever ask for out of a Pizza Cupcake! As it turns out - the Italians did not invent the Pizza, and neither did New Yorkians, or Chicagans. Wikipedia claims it was the Ancient Greece! The Italians only improved upon an ingenious idea.. And it appears that I have, too! Pizza cupcakes offer a personalized serving of gooey, cheesy, bready goodness to everyone!\nI show you how to make a homemade marinara sauce in this Instructable. It is surprisingly easy! You'll wonder why you've never thought of it before... I use store bought dough (from my local grocery store's bakery - Pillsbury works, too!), store bought soy crumbles and Daiya cheese. I encourage you to try this with your own favorite toppings. Do you like olives? Onions? Pepperoni? Step 1: Roasted Garlic. <PIC> I only really have after shots of this process so I apologize. This is very easy to do, and you will probably start doing this all the time, if you don't already... I use roasted garlic in hummus, in sauces, and just spread onto toast. It is SO good.\u00a0\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00ba F (177\u00baC).\u00a0\nSo you'll need one whole bulb of garlic. Start by cutting off just enough of the top to expose most of the cloves just a little bit. Drizzle olive over the cloves and wrap the bulb in tin foil.\u00a0\nPlace in the oven for one hour on middle rack.\u00a0 Step 2: Marinara Sauce. <PIC> Once you realize how easy it is to home-make marinara sauce, I bet you'll never buy it again. One major rule I learned once - Keep it Simple, Stupid!\u00a0\nThings You'll Need\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n2 small onions, chopped. (Or about one heaping cup of chopped onions)\n2 tsp olive oil\n1 heaping tablespoon tomato paste\n1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes\n1/4 tsp dried thyme\n1/4 tsp dried oregano\n1/2 tsp salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\nMince the garlic. I do that in my mini food processor with about half a tablespoon of olive oil. The olive oil helps it to mince.\u00a0\nIn a large sauce pan, heat the oil on med-high heat and cook the garlic until golden brown. DO NOT BURN THE GARLIC.\u00a0\nAdd the chopped onions. Cook for about 7 minutes or until translucent.\u00a0\nStir in the tomato paste with the onions and garlic. Watch the paste get darker red in color. The darker the red, the better the sauce witll taste. This is the key to a super duper awesome sauce. However, do not let the tomato paste burn...\u00a0\nPour in the juice from the crushed red tomatoes and deglaze the pan, and then add in the rest of the tomatoes and the spices.\u00a0\nBring to a simmer and simmer for about 15 minutes.\u00a0\nAdd the roasted garlic and simmer for another 15 minutes, or until desired thickness is achieved.\u00a0 Step 3: Prepare the Cupcake Pan. <PIC> Grease and flour the pan.\u00a0\nRoll out the dough and use a round cookie cutter (or a lid or rim) to cut out circles the size of the bottom of the cupcake. You want the dough about 1/4 inch thick.\u00a0\nPizza dough is frustrating sometimes, so be patient with it! Step 4: Preparing the Cupcakes. <PIC> Scoop a dollop of marinara sauce into each cupcake.

With simple ingredients like rice, milk, sugar and cinnamon, whipping up a rice  pudding is not so difficult. A rice pudding can be thickened with eggs  and baked too. This wholesome rice dessert can be prepared in advance  for parties and family gatherings. Phirni or Firni is a milk-based  creamy dessert popular in the Northern and Frontier regions of India.  It is a kind of rice pudding with a twist! Step 1: Introduction to Rice Based Desserts. <PIC> While most rice puddings use rice in its original form, in firni, rice is ground to a paste. You can whip up some phirni quite easily in a few minutes. It then needs to chill for a while in the refrigerator and you can enjoy it. Ideal for warm sunny climes of the Indian subcontinent. Step 2: Recipe for Phirni. <PIC> What you need :Fragrant Basmati Rice - 1/2 cupGranular sugar 1 1/2 cupNuts of your choice : cashews, pistachios or almonds 1/2 cupGarnish: crushed cardamom - 2 tablespoon Get some fragrant Basmati rice, about 1/2 cup. Wash and soak in water for about 15 minutes. Then coarsely grind it to a paste in a blender with a bit of milk.  Take about 6 cups of milk and put it to boil. Add the ground rice paste and keep stirring to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan.When the mixture begins to thicken, it is time to add the sugar. A test for this is to check if the mixture coats the back of the spoon. About 11/2 cups of sugar should do well for this batch.  Don't forget to keep stirring to avoid lumps.  Add crushed cardamom and chopped nuts such as cashews, pistachios and almonds.Pour this creamy mixture into earthenware bowls. Set it to cool for about an hour. You can cover the bowls with foil to allow the firni to set. In fact, after few hours, firni tastes really good when the flavors acquire a mature level.You can prepare variants of this basic recipe with ground almonds. Another option is to add rose water instead of cardamom for flavor. Kesar phirni can be made with saffron strands added to the cooking mixture. It adds a heady flavor and color. Mango firni is an all-time favorite during summers when mangoes are aplenty. Silver foil paper is sometimes added on top for a festive look.An interesting feature of phirni is that it is served in earthenware bowls called shikoras or khullars. Other than helping the firni to set, these khullars impart an earthy flavor to the dish.Note: The above recipe is inspired by the collection of recipes  from the West coast of India as given here: West Coast of India - recipes", "images_list": ["phirni-creamy-dessert_0", "phirni-creamy-dessert_1", "phirni-creamy-dessert_2"]}

This recipe is ideal for kids that don't like certain ingredients or if you are having peope over for brunch you can set up an \"omelet bar\" and serve your guests 'made to order' omelets. This recipe is simple and virtually fool proof (if you can boil water you can make this omelet)\n\t\u00a0 Step 1: What You Will Need:. <PIC> Large pot, tongs, cutting board, knife, ziploc bags (don't skimp on the bags for this recipe), bowls (one for each ingredient), whisk. Frying pan & spatula (if you have to precook bacon, sausage etc...)\n\u00a0\nINGREDIENTS:\nHere is where you can make each omelet to order.\nFor my omelets I used: Red bell pepper, green bell pepper, onion, sausage (cooked), cheese, and chives\n(you are free to use whatever ingredients you choose such as: bacon, ham, mushrooms, potatoes etc... )\n\u00a0\nTIP: Whenever using sausage, bacon, or ham make sure that the meats are fully cooked\nTIP: If you want cheese, it's best to wait until after your omelet is cooked and top it with cheese. I was told that they don't cook as well if cheese is mixed in but I've never actually tried it so I don't know for sure. Step 2: Let's Get Started. <PIC> * Fill your pot up with water and set it on the stove to boil\n*Prepare your ingredients: dice your onions, peppers, ham, crumble bacon, grate cheese etc. and put each ingredient in it's own bowl\n*Crack open your eggs into a bowl (I typically use 2-3 eggs per omelet) add a little bit of milk or water, salt & pepper (if you desire) then scramble your eggs with a whisk. Step 3: Putting It All Together. <PIC> *Open up your ziploc bag and I find it easier to set it in a cup or bowl just so the bag stands open and upright.\n*Have each person add whatever ingredients that they want in their omelet into their ziploc bag.\n*Pour your scrambled egg mixture in the bag on top of your ingredients.\n*Pull the ziploc bag out of the cup/bowl and before you seal it make sure to get as much of the air out of the bag as you can.\n*Seal your bag\n\u00a0TIP : I rest my ziploc bag against the edge of the counter just above the level of the ingredients then I put the top of the bag down on the counter and run my hand across it towards the top of the bag to remove any excess air then seal the bag tight. (see photo) Step 4: Time to Cook. <PIC> *If you have larger ziploc bags (like the ones I used) Try to roll your bag up.\n*Once you have your omelets zipped up in your bags and your water is at a rolling boil drop your bags into the boiling water.\n*For a 2 egg omelet allow it to boil for 15 min. and for a 3 egg omelet allow it to boil for 17 min.\n*Once your omelets are done remove the bags from your boiling water with tongs. (I usually remove them and set them into an empty bowl).\n*Unzip your bags and your omelet should slide out of the bag onto the plate easily.\n*Garnish with cheese and chives (If desired) and serve.

{"id": "RECIPE_157", "question": "What\u2019s the process for crafting a delicious tangy yogurt cheese spread that everyone will love?", "provenance": [40101], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Tangy Yogurt Cheese Spread. <PIC> This is a very good spread made from yogurt. It is from Alton Brown's show, \"Good Eats\" on the\u00a0Food Network.\u00a0It has a tangy flavor, with the texture of a soft cream cheese. This spread is best on water crackers, but it works on any other cracker as well. It is a hit at parties and get-togethers.  Step 1: Get These Things:. <PIC> For this spread, you'll only need 5 total ingredients, 4 of which you will find in your kitchen already.\nThe first is a tub of plain yogurt. I like to use a whole milk yogurt, such as Mountain High. You'll need a quart of it (yes, I know that's a lot, but it reduces quite a bit). I found that 1 quart of plain yogurt weighs about 2 pounds. Yogurt is sold by weight in the bigger containers, so you can just use a 2lb tub of it, and it will be plenty. (at Safeway, that size tub sells for about $3)\nThe other 4 ingredients that you need (the ones you should already have in your kitchen) are:\n-1 1/2 tsp ground cumin\n-2 Tbsp parsley (you can either use fresh or dried for this, it doesnt matter)\n-1 tsp salt\n-1/2 tsp black pepper\nIn terms of tools, you just need a colander, a bowl that the colander will fit into nicely, and cheesecloth. I found my cheesecloth at Fred Meyer, sold in a package in the cooking utensils area, sold for about $4. Step 2: Assembling the Pieces. <PIC> The way this spread is made is by essentially squeezing out all of the whey from the yogurt. As Alton Brown said on his show, the main difference between\u00a0cheese and yogurt is that cheese has had the whey taken out of it; yogurt has not. Draining the whey from the yogurt makes it thicker, much like a soft cream cheese.\nThe first thing to do is to set up the draining system (this part is very easy). Put the colander on top of the bowl, so that it rests with most of the colander inside the bowl. Now line the colander with the cheesecloth.\n*NOTE*: if you bought the same cheesecloth as I did, it comes in a long, narrow strip. Just fold the long strip in half, then in half again (lengthwise both times). With the second fold, you want to spread it out so that just an inch or so of it overlaps inside the colander.\nNext, mix the yogurt and spices together thoroughly, so that everything's smooth. You'll notice that when you open the yogurt, there is already liquid on top. This is the whey, which you'll mix right back into the yogurt, only to drain it later.\nOnce everything's mixed, pour the yogurt mixture into the cloth-lined colander. Fold the excess cheesecloth over the top of the mixture, so that it is covered completely. To speed up the whey's separation, put a plate on top of the package, and then put some weight on that (a can of vegetables works well. The plate is to distribute the weight evenly across the yogurt. Without this weight, the process could take up to 2 days). Stick the entire assembly in the fridge to rest and drain overnight. Step 3: Check It Out!. <PIC> Because of the mixing, you will not have seen anything draining when you first put it in the fridge. However, when you go and open up the fridge the next morning, check inside the bowl. There should be a fair amount of liquid inside. Unwrap the cheesecloth, and you'll notice that it has turned much thicker. This is the yogurt cheese. It is fairly soft, just a bit softer than cream cheese (like if you had left cream cheese out on the counter for a few hours).\nThis cheese is very good on crackers at parties. is is very tasty, and slightly tangy.\nEnjoy it!\nIf you want to present it, you can put it on a platter (it will flatten out) and put a ring of crackers around it (like I did). It looks good with some parsley sprinkled on top.\nThere are alternatives to the spices you put in the cheese. I found that it tastes very good with sliced pimentos instead of the parsley. Feel free to experiment with different combinations!\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions.", "images_list": ["tangy-yogurt-cheese-spread_0", "tangy-yogurt-cheese-spread_1", "tangy-yogurt-cheese-spread_2", "tangy-yogurt-cheese-spread_3"]}

No problem.  Thaw a pre-made pack of Wild and Brown Rice in the refrigerator (1 \u2013 2 days).  Heat S&B mild golden curry and add cubed pre-cooked chicken.  Heat and plate the Wild and Brown Rice.  Cover with the curry and top with cashew pieces.  Serve with a steamed vegetable, like cauliflower sprinkled with shredded Parmesan cheese.I use an older Panasonic microwave for cooking.  It works well when cooking for two. Step 1: Timeshifting Cauliflower. <PIC> Edit 2016-02-27 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: Finally found a good cauliflower and added four pictures. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- End editCauliflower really doesn\u2019t lend itself much time shifting.  Sometimes they won\u2019t even last a week before developing brown patches.  I get the best shelf life by washing them in a baking soda and surfactant wash, cutting them into major florets, and storing them in the refrigerator in a plastic container with a loose foil lid.  Pick cauliflowers that are solid, white (without yellowing or brown patches), and with firm leaves.  Limp leaves are a sure giveaway that the cauliflower isn\u2019t fresh.  I haven\u2019t tried the green or orange versions.1. Wash, rise, and reduce the cauliflower to large florets.2. Depending on the size of the floret, cut it into bite-sized pieces.  Place in a 2-quart glass measure, spritz with water, and cover. 3. Microwave on High (9-1/2 minutes in my microwave).  4. Drain, \u201cplate\u201d, sprinkle with Parmesan, and serve.Note: Use a sprayer filled with water to wet vegetables for steaming in the microwave.  The smaller size of the droplets is more likely to be converted to steam.Note: Use Chinet paper lunch plates (8-3/4-inches) as lids.  They are sturdy enough to hold the contents when draining. Step 2: Timeshifting Chicken. <PIC> A single breast is enough for this recipe but I normally cook several so they can be used in chicken wraps.Ingredients1 chicken breastOlive oilSalt and pepperMake1. Line a pan with foil.2. Coat the chicken breast(s) with olive oil.  Salt and pepper to taste.3. Cook at 375 degrees F for 23 minutes.  For the Breville oven, use the middle rack, \u201cBake\u201d setting , 375 degrees F, and 23 minutes.4. Cool and place in quart Ziploc bags.  From the refrigerator, cube before use.  From the freezer, cube before freezing and thaw before use.Note: I buy the breasts in bulk at the big box store, portion them in pairs in quart freezer Ziploc bags, and freeze them.  They get thawed in the refrigerator as needed. Step 3: Timeshifting Wild and Brown Rice. <PIC> This is really simple and you can be doing other things while it cooks, which is good because it takes nearly an hour to cook.  Then you can freeze it for when you need it.  When thawed, it only takes four minutes in the microwave to reheat.  I usually make several batches.Ingredients1/4 cup wild rice (57 grams)Fat 1/2 cup brown rice (115 grams)2-1/2 cups water1/2 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon olive oilMake1. Measure all ingredients into a 2-quart glass measure.  Cover with a Chinet paper lunch plate (8-3/4-inches).2. Microwave on High for 8 minutes.  Then microwave on Medium for 40 minutes.  Remove and let sit for 5 minutes.  Stir.3. Let sit, covered, for about 30 minutes to cool enough to put into a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag.  4. Put it in the refrigerator overnight, not the freezer.  Don\u2019t skip this step; you may end up with clumpy rice.  Then put it in the freezer.Use1. Thaw a pack of wild and brown rice in the refrigerator (1 \u2013 2 days).  2. Pour into a 2-quart glass measure.  Microwave on High for two minutes, stir, and on High for two more minutes.  Serve.Note: The frozen Wild and Brown Rice can be thawed on a microwave's defrost setting, although letting the refrigerator do it is much easier. You can start it in the bag and defrost it just long enough to break up the rice.  Overheat it and you run the risk of melting the bag. Step 4: Timeshifting Cashew Curry Chicken With Wild and Brown Rice. <PIC> CAUTION: After heating the water, drop a single piece of curry into the water.  It is eruptive when the whole pot boils at once.  It is entertaining but keep your hands away from the steam and boiling water.

{"id": "RECIPE_197", "question": "What\u2019s the best way to craft a refreshing batch of homemade limoncello?", "provenance": [40127], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Limoncello Recipe. <PIC> Limoncello is a classic Italian liqueur. The process involves using the zest of the lemon peels, which are high in oils, and then steeping in alcohol to impart the lemony-flavour. Traditionally this lovely liquor is made from Sorrento lemons, but common Eureka lemons are just as good.\u00a0\nYou can easily make your own version on limoncello with lemons (or just about any other citrus fruit), splash of sweetener and a healthy dash of vodka. \u00a0What are you waiting for? Grab some lemons and follow along to make your own variant of this delicious mouth-puckering drink!\nWhen life gives you lemons, make limoncello! Step 1: Ingredients + Supplies. <PIC> ingredients:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcitrus fruit / fruit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlemons\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlimes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrapefruits\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(kiwi)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrain alcohol /\u00a0vodka (any type)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsugarsupplies:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcheese grater\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tglass bottles / jars\n\t\t\t\t\t.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\nGrain alcohol is ideal as it's high in alcohol content and is flavourless, however it's not available in some places. Vodka works just fine.\n         Step 2: Zest Fruit. <PIC> Using the fine grating side of a cheese grater, take the zest off your fruit. The zest of the fruit is the coloured portion of the fruit skin and the white portion below is called the pith, the zest holds the oil of the fruit while the pith is bitter. You want all zest and no pith.\u00a0\nEach jar was filled with fruit zest. For the kiwi I sliced into small segments and then muddled the pieces in the jar. After, each jar was filled with vodka.\u00a0The remaining fruit can be made into a citrus meringue,\u00a0squeezed to make fresh juice, or maybe you can find some creative uses.\u00a0 Step 3: Wait. <PIC> After filling each jar was capped and set aside to steep for about 10 days, shake every few days to ensure a good mix.\nDuring this time the zest will infuse the vodka with flavour and colour. Ensure your zest (or fruit) is completely submerged in alcohol to prevent the fruit from rotting while it's steeping. Step 4: Strain + Sweeten. <PIC> After the zest has steeped in vodka for a few days it's time to strain. Using a cheesecloth and a funnel transfer the zesty-vodka to a clean bottle. I chose a decorative bottle, but any bottle with a resealable cap will work.\nMake sure to squeeze the\u00a0cheesecloth after straining to ensure all liquid is removed from the zest.\nNext a solution of simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water) was added to the strained liquid, this will make the drink more\u00a0palatable\u00a0and less bitter. The amount of syrup to add depends on personal taste. I used about 90ml (3 fl.oz) pf simple syrup for 270ml (9fl.oz) of alcohol.\u00a0 Step 5: Serve!. <PIC> Limoncello is served chilled (in chilled glasses) and typically consumed after dinner as a digestif, but is great any time you want a tart refreshment. Try it over vanilla ice cream for a zesty twist on your dessert!Enjoy!\nDid you make your own version limoncello?

You want the width to taper to the root. Then cut onions into teeth shapes.Mix all of your meatloaf ingredients. Form a large oval mound and place on the pan leaving room for the tail to curl next to one side and the head on the other. For the head you form a round dome and a triangle for the snout. I made a little crease in the snout for the upper and lower jaw. Use a picture of a real Opossum for reference. After your shape is looking good you will stick you tail in. Press the meet around it to make sure it stays in when cooked. Do the same with the chicken feet. I had two larger ones I placed in the back and two smaller ones in the front. Then add your onion teeth. Add as many as you like. For the eyes I cut an olive in half and pressed them into the skull. Last I spread catsup all over the top. You can replace this with any glaze you like. Cheese will also give a nice burnt effect. Bake at 350 for one hour.  Step 3: Roast Body Part Veggies. <PIC> To serve with this gruesome meatloaf I chose root vegetables. Beets for bloody hearts, parsnips for sawed bones, and baby carrots for fingers.

Take off the cupcake case that it was baked in so that you just have the cake.\u00a0 Step 1: Naked Cake. <PIC> Use a knife to coat the whole cake with a thin layer of buttercream, it doesn't have to be perfect, just coated enough that the icing with grip it.\u00a0 Step 2: . <PIC> Now colour some ready roll icing with black gel food colouring until it is a good dark black colour and is really mixed in. Put plenty of icing sugar on your work surface and then roll out the black icing into a disc big enough to cover your little cupcake. Smooth the disk of icing over the cupcake and keep rubbing your hands over it until the extra icing sugar and the wrinkles and folds have been smoothed out of it. Trim the extra icing away from the top of the cake so that you have one face open. Next roll a sausage of black icing about 1/2cm thick and then fix it around the open face of the cake to make a lip for the cauldron. It should stick itself on if you are working quickly, if not you may need a little confectioners glue or a little water to help it stick.\u00a0 Step 3: Adding the Bubbles. <PIC> Using a piping bag and wilton icing round tip number 12, pipe little disks of icing over the top of the cake to look like bubbles. I'm afraid this was my first attempt at icing with a piping bag so forgive the uneven bubble sizes! Next I used some tiny bits of white readyroll icing and made them into little balls then stuck a tiny ball of black in the middle to make them look like eye balls and threw them on top of the bubbles. I then used a little orange readyroll icing and rolled it into tiny sausages to look like fingers and threw them in the cauldron too. At the side I added a little stick of black readyroll icing to look like the big mixing spoon.\u00a0\nSorry my camera is terrible. Step 4: . <PIC> That's it! Eat and enjoy, but be warned, the boys all loved these cakes but felt the need to flick the little eyeballs at each other *sigh*\nNext time I would colour the cake mix with a little green colouring so the colour runs all the way through or maybe push a jelly worm into the middle of the cake.\nIf making them for grown ups try soaking those gummi bear sweets in vodka over night and they get huge, then cut a little hole in the cake and hide a gummi in the middle of each cauldron.\u00a0", "images_list": ["witches-brew-creepy-cauldron_0", "witches-brew-creepy-cauldron_1", "witches-brew-creepy-cauldron_2", "witches-brew-creepy-cauldron_3", "witches-brew-creepy-cauldron_4"]}

The list of ingredients is short, the preparation is simple and I guarantee your guests will love it.\nBy the way, you will notice there are no beans in my recipe. True chili does not contain beans. Beans are great on the side but anyone that says beans go in chili is either misinformed or itching for a whoopin.\nHere is the list of ingredients:\n4 pounds of lean beef, chili or hamburger grind\n2 tablespoons of bacon drippings\n1 large white onion, chopped\n2 teaspoons of minced garlic\n3 teaspoons of salt\n1 teaspoon of Mexican oregano\n1 teaspoon of ground cumin\n1 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes\n1 15 ounce can of tomato paste\n2 cups of boiling water\n6 tablespoons of chili powder Step 1: Melt the Bacon Drippings. <PIC> Melt the bacon drippings in a large stock pot over medium heat.\nBacon drippings are a staple here in Texas.

Step 2: Add the Meat. <PIC> When the bacon drippings are melted add your meat.\nBrown the meat evenly and then drain off the excess grease. Step 3: Onions and Garlic. <PIC> Add the onions and garlic. Stir frequently and cook until the onions are translucent. Step 4: Dump in the Rest!. <PIC> Add the remaining ingredients and stir well.\nThe amount and kind of chili powder you add is entirely up to you. We tend to like a lot of heat here in Texas so I usually go with 4 or 5 tablespoons of hot chili powder along with 1 or 2 tablespoons of mild chili powder.\nAllow the mixture to come to a boil and then reduce the heat so that the chili simmers. Allow the chili to simmer uncovered for 1 hour stirring occasionally. Step 5: Enjoy!. <PIC> You can eat the chili as soon as it is done but to be honest it is much better the next day after the flavors have had a chance to mellow and meld.\nYou can eat the chili as it is with perhaps beans and cornbread, Yankee style over spaghetti or perhaps as another classic Texas dish - Frito Pie!

{"id": "RECIPE_220", "question": "What is the overall process for crafting a delightful gingerbread Tardis alongside the Doctor?", "provenance": [40142], "ground_truth": "Introduction: How to Make a Gingerbread Tardis (with Doctor). <PIC> Travel through time and relative dimension in space deliciously!\u00a0\nThis is a fun project that doesn't require a lot of baking experience.\u00a0 It's easier than a Tardis cake, for example, and it keeps longer.\u00a0 It does require a a good bit of working space, but no exotic ingredients.\u00a0 Everything except the gumdrop on top of the Tardis was already in my kitchen. Step 1: Gather Your Materials. You'll need to make sure you have the following things:\n\tlots of countertop or table space\n\tpaper stencils-- you'll print these out in the next step\n\tmetal cookie sheets\u2014try to get ones that won\u2019t warp in the oven\n\tparchment paper\n\tcountertop mixer with dough attachment and whisk attachment\n\trubber/silicone spatulas\n\tfrosting bags and tips, or ziplock bags\n\tcandy thermometer (optional)\n\tmasking tape (optional)\n\tparing knife\n\tfrosting knife or table knife\n\tscissors\n\tlarge cereal box or other light cardboard\n\tpen/pencil\n\tmeasuring cups and spoons\n\trolling pin\n\tlarge metal mixing bowl, other bowls\n\tplastic wrap\n\tspatula\n\tcooling racks\n\thot mitts\n\tlarge shallow pan\n\twhisk\n\twater\n\t1 blue gumdrop or jellybean\n\ttoothpick\n\theavy items to prop up drying pieces (e.g. canned food or books)Check recipes if you're not sure you have enough of these items:\n\teggs\n\tpasturized egg whites (optional)\n\tpowdered sugar\n\tgel food colors\n\tlight brown sugar\n\tunsulfured dark molasses\n\tnonstick spray or oil\n\tall purpose flour\n\tbaking powder\n\tsalt\n\tground ginger, cinnamon, and cloves\n\tmilk\n\tvegetable shortening (Crisco) Step 2: Make Your Stencils. <PIC> \n\tPrint out the templates found in this pdf.\u00a0 For reference, the front elevation and plan view have been included.\u00a0 Trace the paper templates onto light cardboard and cut them out.\u00a0 I used a large cereal box.\u00a0 Remember to label the cardboard pieces so you don't confuse them. Step 3: Make the Gingerbread Dough. \n\tThis recipe worked well for me, but feel free to use your own if you prefer.\n\t\u00be cup unsalted butter\n\t1 \u00bd cup light brown sugar, lightly packed\n\t1 cup unsulfured dark molasses\n\tnonstick spray or oil\n\t2 eggs\n\t1 tablespoon water\u00a0dry ingredients:\n\t5 \u00bd cups all purpose flour\n\t\u00bd teaspoon baking powder\n\t4 teaspoons ground ginger\n\t3 teaspoons ground cloves\n\t2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\n\t\u00bd teaspoon salt\n\tStir together the dry ingredients in a separate bowl and set aside.\u00a0 Cream the butter in a countertop mixer with a dough attachment. (You can do this recipe by hand, but only if you\u2019ve got plenty of upper body strength.\u00a0 A handheld mixer will not be strong enough.)\u00a0 Beat in the brown sugar and eggs.\u00a0 Coat the inside of a measuring cup with nonstick spray or a little oil, then measure out the molasses and add it to the mixing bowl.\u00a0 The oil prevents the molasses from sticking excessively to the measuring cup.\u00a0 Add the water to the mixing bowl and beat.\u00a0 Gradually beat in the dry ingredients, stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides.\u00a0 The dough should be very stiff, almost like Play-doh.\u00a0 If it is still too soft and sticky, add another half cup of flour.\u00a0\nDivide the gingerbread dough into 3 flattish patties, wrap them in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least an hour (up to two days). Step 4: Make the Gingerbread Pieces. <PIC> \n          Preheat oven to 350 degrees and prepare cookie sheets lined with parchment paper.\u00a0 Roll out \u00bc inch thick on parchment paper or a pastry mat, dusting with flour as necessary to avoid sticking.\u00a0 A quarter inch is thicker than you might normally roll cookies, so use a ruler to check.\u00a0 Lay templates on dough and cut out with paring knife.\u00a0 Make sure to cut out the right number of copies of each piece.\u00a0 \nUnstick the pieces by sliding the paring knife underneath them.\u00a0 Use a spatula to transfer the pieces to the cookie sheets with a minimum of distortion.\u00a0 It is a good idea to segregate small pieces on different cookie sheets than large ones, because of the difference in baking times.\u00a0 Once the pieces are on the cookie sheets, lay the templates back on top of them to check that they are still the right shape and size.\u00a0 Use any remaining dough to make anything you like\u2014gingerbread Daleks, K-9, or whatever.\n\t\u00a0Place cookie sheets in preheated oven.\u00a0 Do not overload the oven with more than 2 cookie sheets, because this will cause uneven heating.\u00a0 Watch the pieces through the oven door. \u00a0\u00a0Cooking time varies widely from the small pieces to the large ones.\u00a0 Small pieces are done in as little as 6 minutes, while large pieces could take 20 minutes or more.\u00a0 Pieces are done when their edges and corners start to darken.\u00a0 Don\u2019t overcook\u2014you can always put an undercooked piece back in if you have to.\n\t\u00a0\n\tWith the pieces still on the warm cookie sheets, place the templates back on top of them one last time.\u00a0 Trim the warm gingerbread as needed\u2014once it cools, it will be too brittle.\u00a0 Once the pieces are solid enough, transfer them to a rack to finish cooling. Step 5: Make the \"Glue\" Icing. \n\tRecipe:\n\t4 egg whites (Use 8 tablespoons of pasturized egg white product if you\u2019re worried about salmonella)\n\t5 1/3 cups powdered sugar\n\tgel food colors\n\tNote:\u00a0 There is a small, but measurable, risk inherent in using raw egg whites if you plan to eat your Tardis.\u00a0 This risk is greater for young children, pregnant women, people with compromised immune systems, and the elderly.\u00a0 Even clean, unbroken eggs can be contaminated inside.\u00a0 If you\u2019re worried, you can buy pasturized egg whites in a carton, though these may not foam as well.\n\t\u00a0\n\tFill the large, shallow pan with 1-3 inches of water and put it on the stovetop on medium heat.\u00a0 Clean the metal mixing bowl so that there is no grease, oil, or fat inside.\u00a0 Put the egg whites in the metal mixing bowl, and put it in the pan of water as a double boiler.\u00a0 Whisk the egg whites constantly for several minutes until they are warm to the touch (if you\u2019re using a candy thermometer, 120-130 degrees Fahrenheit, no more).\u00a0 Remove the bowl from the heat, put it immediately into the mixer with the whisk attachment.\u00a0 Starting out slow, build up to high speed.\u00a0 Beat until whites form stiff peaks (when you pull the beaters out, the whites form sharp, somewhat droopy points like a Tim Burton landscape).\u00a0 Gradually beat in the sugar.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\t\u00a0\n\tReserve about a quarter of the icing in a sealed container.\u00a0 Dye the rest dark blue with the gel coloring and put it in an icing bag with a piping tip, or in a ziplock bag with the corner cut off.\u00a0 Once this frosting dries, it is like plaster, but it is soluble in warm water. Step 6: Assemble Your Tardis. <PIC> \n\tAssemble your Tardis in a place where you can leave the pieces without fear that they will be disturbed by unauthorized personnel or pets.\u00a0 As I was making this project, the gingerbread Doctor had to regenerate twice, having twice suffered a horrible fate at the jaws of ravenous dogs.\u00a0 (On the plus side, eating gingerbread seems to improve a dog\u2019s breath.)\n\t\u00a0\n\tGather some heavy items\u2014like cookbooks or canned goods-- to prop up pieces while they set.\u00a0 You can also use masking tape to help hold pieces until they set.\u00a0 Look carefully at the plan view diagram to see how to join the pieces, or the Tardis won\u2019t be square.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve broken any pieces, glue them back together with icing.\n\t\u00a0\n\tAssembly order:\n\t1. back+1 side, roof pieces to each other\n\t2. other side\n\t3. base\n\t4. roof\n\t5. front left\n\t6. top right\n\t7. front right door (I left it slightly open)\n\t8. frame edges\n\t9. signs\n\t\u00a0Glue the back to one of the sides first using the blue icing.\u00a0 Pipe a line along the edge and another line inside the angle of the join, like caulk.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry too much if icing shows on the outside; that\u2019s why we dyed it blue.\u00a0 Prop the pieces up and leave them to set for at least an hour.\u00a0 While you\u2019re waiting, you can start on assembling the roof and decorating the Doctor.\u00a0 I used masking tape and a pop bottle lid to hold the roof pieces at an angle while they set.\n\t\u00a0\n\tOnce the back and first side have set, add the second side and leave it to set again.\u00a0 These first few pieces will need the longest setting time.\u00a0 After these, the Tardis will have a little more stability and you can get away with working faster.\u00a0 If something is misplaced, it\u2019s better to find out before the glue has set all the way (3 hours, give or take).\u00a0 \n\t\u00a0\n\tNext, glue the back and sides onto the base and glue the roof on.\u00a0 Stick the front left panel in place, making sure that there is space for the last pieces to fit in.\u00a0 Stick on the upper right panel, over the door opening.\u00a0 Put the door in at the angle you choose.\u00a0 Stick the upright frame edges in place (consult the plan diagram) and stick the top frame edges in place like lintels.\u00a0 Allow to set and stick the signs on.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Step 7: Decorate Your Doctor. <PIC> Divide the reserved glue icing into small bowls for different colors, as many as you want for the doctor and his outfit.\u00a0 Remember to leave some white for decorating the Tardis if you haven\u2019t done that yet.\u00a0 Keep any icing you're not using sealed so it doesn't dry out.\nUse the gel colors to tint the icing.\u00a0 With gel coloring, a tiny bit goes a long way.\u00a0 Mix to get the colors you want; for example, combine red and green to get brown.\u00a0 Ice the Doctor.\u00a0 For the eleventh Doctor, you\u2019ll need brown for his coat shoes and hair, peach for his skin, red for the fez and his shirt stripes, white for his shirt, a tiny bit of purple for a bow tie, and a smidge of pink for his mouth.\u00a0 You already have blue for his pants.\u00a0 I also iced a little piece of toothpick to make a sonic screwdriver for him to hold.\u00a0 The tip of a toothpick is useful for icing the details on the Doctor, too. Step 8: Turn Your Tardis Blue. \n\tYou may choose to leave your Tardis a traditional gingerbread brown.\u00a0 If you want a blue Tardis, however, you will need to frost it because the molasses makes the gingerbread dough itself too dark to dye.\u00a0 This recipe is the kind of frosting you\u2019d get on a supermarket cake, chosen for spreadability, color, and shelf life, so don\u2019t expect it to taste as good as a buttercream.\u00a0I chose to use frosting instead of the plasticky-smooth rolled fondant that is de rigueur for cakes these days, because the Tardis is wooden and slightly battered.\n\t\u00a0\n\tBlue frosting for outside of Tardis:\n\t1/3 cup vegetable shortening (Crisco)\n\t1/8 teaspoon salt\n\t2 cups powdered sugar (more or less)\n\t2 tablespoons milk (more or less)\n\tCream the shortening and beat in the salt.\u00a0 Beat in the milk and gradually add the sugar.\u00a0 If the consistency isn\u2019t how you like it for spreading, add more sugar or milk as necessary.\u00a0 Color with gel coloring.\u00a0 This frosting tends to darken slightly on the surface as it dries.\u00a0\n\tMake sure the Tardis has securely set.\u00a0 To be safe, I let mine dry overnight before I frosted it.\u00a0 Frost the Tardis with a knife.\u00a0 If you are more of a perfectionist than I am, you can smooth it with a scrap of parchment paper as the frosting sets. Step 9: Add Decorative Details to the Tardis. <PIC> \n\tPipe the windows on with white glue icing.\u00a0 I did this freehand, but if you are feeling very precise you can make the windows as squares on parchment paper and stick them onto the Tardis once they dry.\u00a0 Draw the square inset panels onto the Tardis freehand with the dark blue glue icing.\u00a0 Divide the window panes and write on the front sign with the dark blue icing, too.\u00a0 Spread dark blue as the background of the \u201cPolice Box\u201d signs.\u00a0 Write \u201cPolice Box\u201d on the signs in white.\u00a0 Glue the gumdrop on top. Step 10: Enjoy!.

{"id": "RECIPE_234", "question": "What are some effective ways to neutralize spiciness when it becomes overwhelming in your mouth?", "provenance": [40150], "ground_truth": "Introduction: How to Neutralize Spiciness in Your Mouth. <PIC> This is a guide on how to get rid of the heat in your mouth when it becomes unbearable to deal with. This contains one of the most effective methods to get rid of a lot of spiciness with little use of beverages. Step 1: Understanding Spiciness. <PIC> Spiciness is commonly related to peppers, but it can also be caused by other foods and is consistent with more acidic foods. Although acidic foods are not always spicy, a majority of spicy foods are acidic. There is a measurement of capsaicin in peppers and what it takes to dilute it with water. The numbers on the Scoville scale are equivalent to how many cups of water it takes to dilute the capsaicin in the specified food. So when a pepper reaches 300,000 Scoville units... it becomes hopeless to dilute the capsaicin with water. This is especially difficult due to the fact that capsaicin is an oil and water mainly just moves it around. That is where other liquids and beverages come in handy in neutralizing the capsaicin.For a more public setting solution go to step four! Step 2: Neutralizing Spiciness for the Lactose Tolerant. The most common go to for getting rid of the heat (aside from water) is milk. Some people believe that if they drink enough milk they can get rid of the burn, but instead of destroying it... they just move it to their stomachs. The method I know of may not be the most polite, but it will stop the burn. The method I use is quite simple and effective as long as you follow these steps:1. Fill your mouth partway up with milk2. Swish the milk around to mix it with the heat3. Spit it out instead of swallowing it4. Repeat these steps up to 4 timesThe most it ever took me to do this was 2 times. However, the results may not be the same if you eat a Bhut Jolokia (Ghost pepper) when you can barely handle a Jalapeno.Go to step three if Lactose Intolerant! Step 3: Neutralizing Spiciness for the Lactose Intolerant. The concept is the same as that of milk, but the steps are slightly different:1. Put about a teaspoon of white sugar into your mouth2. Let your saliva dissolve the sugar3. Swish the liquid around your entire mouth4. Spit the liquid out5. Repeat this process up to four timesSame rules apply as the milk. Step 4: Neutralizing Spiciness in a Public Setting. If you happen to run into a spicy food problem at a restaurant you will not want to be spitting out liquids. Here are the steps for anyone to take in such a scenario:1. Bring some sugary gum with you2. Chew the gum for a few minutes (at max)3. As you would normally do with gum... spit it out discreetlyI hope this has been an informative Instructable.

The microwave gives you overcooked, rubbery cheese and lots of hot spots.\nDoing it either under the broiler or in the oven gives you soft, melted cheese and everything is nice and warm.\nAnd it takes very little time - nachos in ten minutes or less, especially if you keep prepped ingredients on hand! Step 1: What You'll Need:. <PIC> \n\t\tplate of tortilla chips\n\t\tbeans or meat of choice\n\t\tdiced veggies\n\t\ttwo handfuls shredded cheese\n\t\ta broiler or oven set to 375 F\n\t\tan oven safe plate\nYou can change this stuff up a ton! As far as the tortilla chips, I like using round ones because they're more bite-size. But we've even used doritos as tortilla chips. Sometimes I'll do refried beans, and sometimes I'll just use black beans. Shredded chicken, ground beef and chorizo are my favorites on nachos. And as far as veggies, I always use lots of red onion, fresh jalapeno, and bell pepper. Pickled jalapenos work well and give the nachos a wonderful vinegar-y kick. Cheese is up to you - we normally use cheddar because it's what we have on hand. Step 2: Veggies!. <PIC> Dice your veggies up and put them all over. I'd say I use a couple tablespoons of each. The more the better, honestly. Make sure they're distributed evenly.  Step 3: Meat or Beans... or Both.. <PIC> Now add your proteins! I like to heat up meat or refried beans up before I put them on. It'll make the refried beans easier to deal with, and make sure the meat is nice and warm.  Step 4: Add the Cheese!. <PIC> I like to do at least two handfuls of cheese. Just keep going until it looks like a good amount for you.\nYou want it to be nicely covered, but not drowning in it. Step 5: Broil or Bake!. <PIC> Broiling is the best method. I have a gas oven with the broiler in the bottom and it takes only a minute or two for the nachos to be done. If you have an electric oven, it will take a wee bit longer to broil. Just don't walk away, and set the timer for a minute at a time and check after every minute.\nIn a preheated 375 F oven, it will take closer to 5 minutes.\nYou just want the cheese to be fully melted, but not browned. Once it's starting to brown you're on the way to burnt city. :D\nThese are awesome served with sour cream or guacamole. (Need a guacamole recipe? I've got one!)

{"id": "RECIPE_241", "question": "What are the essential steps to create a delightful birch sap wine from scratch?", "provenance": [40154], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Birch Sap Wine. <PIC> It is said that the sap of birches has many virtues. My (vain) grandfather smeared it on his head to prevent hairloss and it is generally believed that it is an excellent treatment for poor health, as a revitalising tonic etc. It is a watery substance, slightly sweet with a silky taste. It is also used to make excellent wines. Birch sap is harvested at the end of winter by the end of February, early March when the first buds start to swell. The harvesting period is short: about two weeks, so if you want to do this you will need to keep a close watch on nature. The recipe I used is taken from an old book by the excellent J.C.C. Berry. Wine making is not difficult; just make sure you work very clean with sterilised equiment. See my instructable on making rose hip wine on this subject.  Step 1: What Will You Need?. <PIC> You will need the following stuff. Most can be found in your shed and local supermarket, the rest is bought from a specilised wine makers shop. Quantities are for 5 litres, scale up or down as needed.A hydrometer  Waterlock(s)  measuring glass  a cork or plug with a hole in it  a hard-plastic or glass pipe, 5-10 cm that snugly fits in the hole in the above cork  A tube, 100-150 cm. The diameter should fit the above pipe  A drill with the same diameter as the small end of the cork  A drilling machine (or hand drill) you can take out in the field  Yeast (we will make a white wine, so can use e.g. Elzas style yeast)  Yeast nutrient  1500 g. sugar, 500 g. raisins, 2 lemons, 2 oranges (use organic raisins, lemons & oranges, you do not want chemicals in your wine)  Something to sterilise your equipment, I use sulphite.  A vessel, large bottle or Demijohn for collecting & fermenting. Actually: it helps to have two/three since you will need to rack off the wine a few times while clearing. You can also use food-grade plastic buckets for this; you can probably get them at a local snack bar or restaurant, they use them for sauses. Make sure you get the lid as well. Drill a small hole in the lid to connect the waterlock; make sure the waterlock is not leaking. A large (soup) pan  5 litres of Birch Sap. Step 2: Collecting Your Sap. <PIC> So you will need to collect 5 litres of birch sap! As said before: the time to do this is when the first buds start to swell, late February, early March. Look for a period without frost. Frozen liquid will expand and can break your bottle. Look out for large and healthy trees with a diameter of at least 25 cm. Remember that you rob the tree of vital nutrients, so keep it reasonable. Do not harvest more than 5 litres from one tree and treat the tree with respect. There are two ways of collecting. The first is by cutting off the end of a branch and shove a bottle over it. Tie the bottle to the branch and you will see the sap dripping down almost immediately. This is nice for small amounts, and we need at least 5 litres. This is how you go about: prepare the tube by connecting the pipe and cork. The cork will go into the tree. Clean a large bottle and connect the other side of the tube to the bottle. On the photo you can see I use a rubber cap used to put a waterlock on a bottle; this works perfectly. Drill a shallow hole in the tree, point your drill slightly upwards; you want the sap to flow down. The height should be higher than the bottle you use; sap flows down, remember? There is no need to drill deeper than 2-3 cm since the sap flows just below the bark. Put the cork in the hole you drilled, make sure it fits tightly. Make sure everything is steady; make sure the bottle cannot be toppled over by cattle or wild animals. Leave and come back the following days to see the progress. After a few days (the sap will flow surprisingly fast!) the bottle will be full. Take the cork out of the hole and plug it firmly with a piece of wood; you may need a hammer for this. This is important since the tree can literally bleed to death if you don't do this. Actually: a few weeks later you will notice that the tree you tapped from will grow leaves 2-3 weeks later than trees you did not tap from. Say thank-you to the tree and take the birch sap home and put it in a dark cool place.  Step 3: Make Wine. <PIC> Mix the yeast with a cup of luke warm water and let it rehydrate for 2-3 hours on a warm spot  Chop the raisins finely  Peel the lemons and oranges, remove all the white stuff from the fruit and squize out al the sap.  Heat the birch sap to at least 90 C (or cook, I don' t cook it since I want as mucb flavour as possible) add the lemon/orange peel and sugar, make sure the sugar dissolves. Do this for 20-25 minutes. Take a sample and weigh it with the hydrometer. Ideally you should read around 1080. When below: add some sugar. When above: prepare for a sweet wine or add water/sap. You can do this in batches if your pan isn't big enough; make sure you cover the vessel/bottle thoroughly every time to prevent polution by wild yeasts and other vermins.Put the chopped raisins in the vessel/bottle you will use for the fermentation, pour the liquid over it. Make sure the bottle is filled no more than 50%. The fermentation will produce froth that can come out through the waterlock creating a mess. You do not want that. You may want to use multiple vessels for this stage, when the fermentation is out of its \"wild\" phase you can mix them together.  When the temperature of the liquid matches the temperature of the rehydrated yeast, pour the yeast in the liquid, add the yeast nutrient.  Close the vessel(s), add waterlock and let the fermentation begin!  When the fermentation slows down you rack the wine off leaving all the rubbish in the first vessel. When there are no more bubbles in the waterlock you weigh the wine again. For a dry wine your hydrometer should read around 990. Higher means more sugar is left, resulting in a sweeter wine. Do this every two months untill the wine is perfectly clear. Make sure you leave no more than 2-3 cm under the rim of the bottle to avoid oxydation. Use any good white wine available to top off when necessary.   Bottle the wine, leave to mature for a few months and enjoy with your friends!", "images_list": ["birch-sap-wine_0", "birch-sap-wine_1", "birch-sap-wine_2", "birch-sap-wine_3"]}

For those of you who haven't used fresh chillies before, make sure when you cut them up you are using gloves or put clean plastic bags over your hands like I do. If you like you chilli hot pop the whole thing in, if you don't I would avoid adding the seeds as they are the hottest part of the chilli. Also make sure you have checked how hot the chillies are, I have homegrown ones and I can't remember the type, but my red ones are very hot but sweet and give a great flavour, whereas the green are not as hot. Just choose the quantity and type of chillies based on your own taste.Put a little oil in a large saucepan and gently fry the onion, making sure not to burn it. Add the garlic, peppers and all of the herbs and spices (if you are using green peppers as I have you will need to give them a little extra time just so that they soften). Add the Quorn and cook a little (if you are using meat then cook until brown).Add the tomatoes and tomato puree and stir.

Let this cook for  approximately half an hour, but if you are in a hurry you can cook it a lot quicker, the meat should already be cooked at this point so you can just heat it up. Personally, however, I prefer to leave  the saucepan on simmer for between 30 minutes and 45 minutes. Then give  it a taste and add seasoning to your taste. Step 4: Eatsies. <PIC> Now it is ready to eat. We like to add a little plain yogurt and some thinly sliced or grated cheddar cheese. Mmmmm.

{"id": "RECIPE_270", "question": "What are the essential steps for crafting a delicious peanut butter and pickle sandwich?", "provenance": [40174], "ground_truth": "Introduction: How to Make a Peanut Butter & Pickle Sandwich. <PIC> I know what you're probably thinking right now; \"Ew! A peanut butter & pickle sandwich? GROSS!\" However, all I have to say is, don't knock it till you try it. Peanut butter & pickle sandwiches are actually quite delicious. I will now show you the proper way of making this awesome sandwich.Things You Will Need:- Bread (whichever kind you prefer)- Peanut Butter (crunchy or creamy; doesn't matter)- Pickles (whichever kind you prefer)- Butter Knife (for spreading the peanut butter on the bread)- Sharp Knife (for cutting he pickles)- Toaster (optional; if you want to toast your bread first) Step 1: Toast Your Bread. Technically, this step is optional (but I highly recommend doing this step to optimize the deliciousness of the sandwich).Before you begin, you want to make sure that your toaster is plugged into a working outlet. And if you would like to butter your bread, make sure you do that after you toast it! Now you are ready to toast your bread. Grab both your slices and place them in the toaster. You can toast your bread whichever way that you prefer. Unless you like to burn your toast. Don't do that, it's gross. Step 2: Lay Your Slices Side by Side. <PIC> Now that you\u2019ve finished toasting your bread (unless you for some reason skipped that step), grab it from the toaster. Make sure you use caution; the toast can be very hot. Place both slices on a flat surface (i.e. a plate) side by side. Step 3: Spread Peanut Butter on Both Slices. <PIC> This next step is super important; unless you just want to make a pickle sandwich, then I guess you can just skip this step. It is time to put some peanut butter on your bread. Open the jar of peanut butter and put as much peanut butter as you would like on your butter knife. Now spread the peanut butter across one slice of bread. Once you are finished, repeat for the second slice. Step 4: Prepare Pickles for Your Sandwich. <PIC> Put your sandwich off to the side; we\u2019ll come back to it in a minute. This step is when you\u2019ll need the pickles and the sharp knife. Grab a few pickles out of the jar (pro tip: I usually end up using about 4 pickles), and place them on a surface to cut them (pro tip: I use the plate that I use for my sandwich). Then, using the sharp knife, you need to cut the pickles in half (I recommend cutting them the same way shown in the video; otherwise, your sandwich will be lumpy and weird).  Step 5: Place Pickles on Your Sandwich. <PIC> This is another really important step; your sandwich won't turn out right if you do this wrong. You need to carefully lay your newly sliced pickles on top of one of your peanut butter covered bread slices. With this step, it's kind of like you are playing Tetris\u2122, you need to fit the pickle slices together so they don't hang awkwardly over the side of your sandwich. Step 6: Complete Your Sandwich. <PIC> Now for the final step. When you finish this, you will have a delicious peanut butter & pickle sandwich. You need to grab one of the slices of bread (I recommend grabbing the one that doesn't have the pickles on it; it'll make this a lot easier). Flip it over so the peanut butter side is down. Now gently place it on top of the other slice of bread. And voila! You now have a completed peanut butter & pickle sandwich.

This works even better if you're a blokey bloke, with oil and muck permanently lodged under your finger nails; the kind of man whose woman knows that hitherto even the notion of making chocolates would be an afront to your manly manlyness.Not any more though, as these chocolates don't use sprinkley sprinkley bits, or lavender oil or any such lady ingredients. No, these chocolates use metal. Hard, manly metal. Not only that - they use metal that even a woman can get behind and understand. They use Gold and Silver! Surely there has never been a better way to both gastronomically treat and impress your better half than with these shiny sweetmeats.Ok, flowery words apart, what does a bloke need to make all this happen using his own rough hewn hands and most likely, very limited kitchen capabilities: Step 1: Required Stuff. <PIC> 1. You will need EDIBLE gold and silver leaf supplies. I emphasise the word EDIBLE as it is available as a crafting product and as a food product. The crafting product appears to be around the same price, but it may be alloyed with inedible metals. Perhaps not, but in any case, your loved one won't appreciate aluminium or lead in her chocs. A quick google search will quickly help you obtain this. I got mine from a supplier in Switzerland, which when dropped into the post-eating conversation, sounds suitably impressive.2. Given that you're springing lots of cash on gold/silver leaf you don't want to be making your chocolates with nasty Tesco value chocolate, you want to be getting some decent quality stuff. I'll leave it up to the reader to make the call on what's locally available or prefered by the recipient. For mine, I made a mix of very dark/high cocoa chocolate, smooth milk chocolate and creamy white chocolate, to cover all bases.3. Any extra ingredients? Fresh ginger makes a nice additive if you can crush it and extract the oil. It brings the dark chocolate to live and makes it zingy on the tongue.4. A mold for your chocolates. I obtained a nice plastic mould with varied heart shapes from my favourite auction site.5. A nice presentation box and some tissue paper to line it with.6. Oh, and a small, soft brush for applying the leaf. Your wife's make up brushes, suitably cleaned, work fine for this, but any soft-bristled painting brush from your kids craft box will do fine. Most gilding sites will suggest buying their super-soft brushes at a cost of \u00a320, and whilst I'm sure it'll work alot better than my cheapo alternative, it's probably not \u00a320 better. Step 2: Step 1 - Making the Chocolate. <PIC> This is probably the most important part, since if you make a pigs-ear of this step, no amount of gilding can  make your chocolates palatable to your loved one. And whilst it might be amusing to look on as she pretends that they're lovely, whilst simultaneously choking them down and repressing her gag reflex, it's probably not what you're trying to achieve with this endeavour.I know consumate cooks would never advocate the use of a microwave oven, and would always say to melt your chocolate on the stove inside a bowl suspended in boiling water. But we're blokes remember, and doing that is tantamount to wearing a big flowery apron. No, we're going to use the microwave. It was your best friend when you were single and you're not going to abandon it now that you're hitched.So here's what to do:1. Get 100-200 grams (i.e. a big bar) of chocolate and break it down into little cubes. Most chocolate will be formed into this anyway, so just break it up. Taste a little and put the rest in a microwavable bowl. Or, if you're me, the first bowl that comes out of the cupboard. Just make sure it's clean and free of meat sauce from last night's take away.2. Melt the chocolate in the microwave. Now - this is the bit where it can go wrong. You have to be really slow and patient doing this. You need to put the microwave on for about 10 seconds at a time, take the bowl out and stir the chocolate until it starts to leave traces on the bottom of the bowl. At the start, this won't appear to happen at all and the temptation is to stick it in for 30 seconds at a time. If you do this you'll mess your chocolate up and most likely start a small fire. 10 seconds at a time, take out, stir, put back in. That's the order of the day. You have to stir until as much choc melts as possible before putting it back in again. It should be the stirring that makes it melt, not sitting it in the microwave.3. Add any flavourings such as ginger oil or fresh vanilla pod or orange oil, or whatever she likes. One or two drops will do for about 200g of chocolate. Adding a load will stop your chocolate from setting, so be careful.4. Make sure you have your mold to hand once the chocolate has melted. It should stay melted for a few minutes and if it starts to harden can be melted gently as before.5. Carefully pour the choc into the mold.6. Let it cool naturally on the work surface for 15-30 minutes, but at this point it will still be very soft to the touch, so then you can put it into the fridge for about 15-30 minutes to make sure if goes hard. I observed that the higher the milkfat content in the chocolate then the longer it takes to harden and the easier it is to melt to the touch.Once it has set, you can remove it from the mold and begin to adorn it with your bling. Step 3: Gilding Your Chocs. <PIC> This is frankly, the most difficult bit, and when you look at the images, you'll see that I wasn't altogether successful with it. But women like a trier, so don't let your lack of artistic talent stop you from doing this. I mean, you won't know if you can apply gold leaf until you try - there's pretty much no other practical skill you can practise before this to make it any easier for you. It's an art-form in itself. Perhaps if you're good at soldering and have a steady hand then it'll help you. I'm crap at soldering too, so that probably why my applications look so bad.Gold leaf it thin. Very thin. It's not paper thin. It's air thin. So much so that if you open your gold leaf sheet and inhale sharply you might get a lungful. Seriously, it's nano-thickness and will attach to surfaces which come close to being in contact with it. It's a bit like cling flim, but cling won't disintegrate if you try to remove from your finger when it sticks. Gold and silver leaf will.However, being a practical bloke, you will use this to your advantage. At first, I wanted to completely coat an entire chocolate in gold. I was successful in doing this, but it looked wrong, and inedible. It looked even more wrong, when I did it with silver leaf, as it looked like it was still in the wrapping paper.So I decided to flake my leaf and apply it 'artistically'. Some might say unevenly and perhaps even inelegantly and sporadically, but I'll stick with my original claim.Here's how you do it:1. Get your chocolate right next to your gold leaf envelope and carefully open the top paper from the leaf.2. Turn it upside down onto your chocolate and brush gently with your soft brush. It'll probably tear a little bit, but that's fine. With enough practise you'll know how much pressure to apply to smooth the leaf and how much to apply to break a bit off.3. Tastefully apply in this manner and smooth the leaf onto the chocolate. The colder the chocolate is here, the better the result will be.4. Um...that's the extend of my expertise on this matter. It'll largely be trial and error here, but just do your best and try a few different things. At least you can always eat what goes wrong! What could be better! And with every bite you're adding value to your worthless carcass! Step 4: Boxing It Up and Closing Thoughts. <PIC> When you have finished, blinking the sweat and most likely, stray bits of metal, from your eyes, you can relax in the knowledge that you're almost done. The woman of your dreams will soon be revering you as a manly God you will no doubt feel you are at this moment in time.But don't give in yet. She won't be swooning in your arms if you crudely wrap them up in newspaper or put them in a cleaned out tin of 40/20 multigrade. You'll need to think how a women thinks and find something soft, girly and possibly even pink to put them in.Luckily, I had something that I could recycle in the house, so I didn't have to be seen outside with a pink silk box - phew! But at any rate, be practical and line it with tissue paper (from the crafting store) and place chocs gently into the box. If you have enough chocs to make a few layers then separate out with bits of grease-proof paper otherwise thely'll all stick together and the leaf will transfer between them. Not nice.And that's pretty much it. My lady was very much appreciative of the effort I put in this year and when she got talking with her friends and they all said that their blokes bought them nothing/ironing boards etc. I knew that they were all secretly jealous of my awesome skills and 'sensitive side'.Job done!", "images_list": ["making-gold-amp-silver-leaf-chocolates_0", "making-gold-amp-silver-leaf-chocolates_1", "making-gold-amp-silver-leaf-chocolates_2", "making-gold-amp-silver-leaf-chocolates_3", "making-gold-amp-silver-leaf-chocolates_4"]}

There was something about that taste that seemed out of reach. I could never duplicate it until I tried a true Bavarian recipe. That means using food grade Sodium Hydroxide or what you may know as LYE.....The faint hearted should hit the back button now but know that the great Pretzel taste is possible..... Step 1: Making the Dough. <PIC> I use a slightly modified version of Alton Brown's pretzel recipe.The dough ingredients are:1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F)1 tablespoon granulated sugar2 teaspoons kosher salt1 package active dry yeast4 1/2 cups all-purpose flourThe dip ingredients are:10 cups water1/2 cup food grade Sodium HydroxideOther Ingredients: Celtic Sea saltMix the water, sugar, salt, and yeast in the bowl of your mixer. After about 20 minutes it should foam up. If it doesn't your yeast was dead so start over....If its nice and foamy put the bowl on the mixer with a dough hook and set it on low. Keep adding the flour until it comes together into a ball.Turn that out onto a board and flour it so you can knead it a couple of times. it doesn't need much....Set it aside and let it rise. Don't fall asleep or you may come back to a mushroom cloud.if you do beat it down and  divide it up so you can move on. Step 2: The Dip. <PIC> just like in Roger Rabbit this is nasty stuff. Wear Gloves and Eye protection.Goggles are a buck or two and really are needed.....if you get some on your fingers it may feel soapy. Well that your skin melting. The liquid is NOT soapy. It take about 10 minutes before it will hurt...Just flush with plenty of water.Only use a pyrex Glass or Stainless pot. NEVER Aluminum. That will make Hydrogen Gas.... Not what you want in your kitchen....I use an all Stainless Steel Spider too.Add the 10 cups to the pot FIRST. Then add the Sodium Hydroxide SLOWLY. It makes a lot of heat and if you do it in the reverse direction by adding water to the powder it will flash into steam...You should use steel pans too.I use aluminum sheet pans lined with Parchment paper. In 6 batches of Pretzels I had 2 drops hit the pan and it left these permanent marks.... Step 3: Nuggets . <PIC> These are easy. Just roll out a 1 1/2 inch diameter log and slice it up with a pastry scraper.i then use the Spider to dip them for a couple of seconds. Really just lower them to the bottom then raise them out and transfer them to the parchment lined baking sheets. they will turn yellow in a few seconds. thats normal....I keep the spider in the pot and the pot touching the sheet tray so theres little chance of dripping on my counter.Once dipped I top with Celtic Sea Salt and then bake in a 450 oven until golden brown. usually about 10 - 12 minutes.you can use an egg wash but its not needed. the dip will give them the color. Step 4: Pretzels. <PIC> You start the same way rolling the dough into a 1 inch round log. Then twist into a pretzel.I also like to braid three strips into a loaf.I've even tried little buns. No pictures because they were that good....Dip like the others then salt to taste.....see the pic of a dipped vs undipped to see the difference in color a couple of seconds makes. Step 5: Eating. <PIC> Your reward is here.That great authentic Bavarian pretzel taste is yours.You could dip in Mustard but you really don't need it....I use up my empty take out containers to make individual portions for people.

{"id": "RECIPE_302", "question": "What is the process for creating a stunning Holiday Wreath Cake that\u2019s sure to impress your guests?", "provenance": [40193], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Holiday Wreath Cake. <PIC> Its the time of year where all we seem to do is eat. Here is a simple cake decorating Instructable that is easy enough for the non-baker, yet impressive enough to \"wow\" the in-laws! Step 1: I Need It!. <PIC> First things first, what do you need to make such a cake.1. Bunt Cake Whether you want to take the time to make a homemade cake, or simply use a box mix. Both are technically made at home, so add a box of pudding to a cake mix along with some extra vanilla or butter extract and no one will tell if its box mix or not...our little secret.2. Cake Icing The type of icing is up to you, I prefer cream cheese but again its totally my taste buds making that decision.\u00a03. Cloth artificial leaves This is your preference. If you are making a Christmas Wreath cake use fake holly leaves, for a more Thanksgiving/Fall theme use maple or whatever you find more \"fall-like\".4. Melting Chocolate & Food Coloring If you are making a Fall/Thanksgiving cake you will need autumn colors,\u00a0 orange, brown, yellow... A Christmas cake you will obviously want to purchase form green melting chocolate.5. Freezer  To speed up the leaf making process6. Soft Caramel Candies & Brown Sprinkles (Only needed for Thanksgiving Cake) Doesn't matter the brand just as long as they are pliable enough to shape into acorns.\u00a0 Step 2: Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness.. If you have just purchased the artificial leaves I recommend cleaning them before using them to make this cake. Unless you aren't going to eat any of the cake, and frankly don't care anything about the people that are going to partake in the consumption of such a beautiful cake; then again I don't see putting the time into cooking for people you loath. Anyways, you may want to soak the leaves in a soapy water solution for 30 min or so and rinse them thoroughly just to be on the safe side.\u00a0  Step 3: You Only Live Once, Lick the Bowl.. Before you can impress anyone with a totally amazing wreath cake, you must first have a cake to decorate, So you must make a bunt cake. As I stated before you can make one from scratch if you feel the need, however I don't find that necessary when I can tweak a box mix to taste just as good as homemade if not better. So follow your recipes or read the back of the box. Once your cake is baked, set it aside to cool. You want the cake to be completely cooled. A warm cake will melt your icing causing it to run and make a sticky mess, not to mention if you place your leaves on a warm cake they will also melt.  Step 4: You Make Me MELT.. Melting Chocolate. You want to take a microwave safe bowl, I used a basic glass cereal bowl, and pour about a third of the melting chocolate into the bowl. This does not have to be an exact measurement because we can melt more if needed, no biggie. Microwave the chocolate for 30 sec. at half power, then stir the chocolate (very little or none will appear melted). Microwave for an additional 15 sec. this time at full power, again stir. Continue microwaving the chocolate in 15 sec. interval until it is completely melted, making sure to stir it after it is microwaved each time.  Step 5: \"Autumn Is a Second Spring Where Every LEAF Is a Flower.\" -Alber Camus. <PIC>  Before you begin making the leaves, you will first want to place a clean baking sheet within arms reach of where you will be making the leaves, (Choose a baking sheet that will fit in your freezer) Now the preparations are made and we can make leaves! Examine the artificial leaf, you will notice one side looks like a leaf, while the other side has a wire glued to it. You will want to coat the side of the leaf that does NOT have the wire on it. So here we go, Pick up a artificial leaf, stick the index finger of your free hand into the melt chocolate. Coat the leaf with the chocolate, you want to make sure the chocolate is thick so that it will be easier to remove from the artificial leaf. Try your best to only get the chocolate on one side of the leaf and not on the wire. If chocolate laps over to the other side it will be okay, just harder to remove the artificial leaf without breaking the chocolate. As you can imagine chocolate leafs are quite delicate, much like real leaves. Once you have coated a leaf with chocolate place it, chocolate side up, on your baking sheet. Repeat this process until all your leaves are coated in chocolate, and place the baking sheet into the freezer.\u00a0 Now lick your finger, you know you want to! Step 6: \"The Creation of a Thousand Forests Is in One Acorn.\" - Ralph Waldo Emerson. <PIC> While the leaves are literally chillin' in the freezer, I like to feel productive and use this time to make the acorns for my wreath cake. Take the caramel candies and open a handful. Usually the candy I purchase are larger than I would like. If this is the case for you as well roll the candy slightly, this will warm the caramel and elongate it slightly. At this point I break the caramel into two separate pieces. I also like doing this because it doubles the amount of acorns I can possibly make. (I never use a whole bag, but my dad loves these caramels so he is quite happy with almost a full bag to himself.) Once you have the caramel the size you prefer, roll it between the palms of your hands until it is oval in shape (acorn shape). Repeat this process until you have the number of acorns you desire for your cake. You can then take the acorns and apply a small amount of icing to which ever side you deem the top of the acorn. Take the iced top of the acorn and dip it in the brown sprinkles, you can secure the sprinkles to the caramel by gently pressing them into the icing. This will give it a smoother appearance. Set the acorns aside for the time being.  Step 7: \u201cAll You Need Is Love. But a Little CHOCOLATE Now and Then Doesn't Hurt.\u201d \u2015 Charles M. Schulz. <PIC> Back you our leaves. By now the chocolate leaves has hardened nicely. Take the baking sheet out the freezer, and grab something to place the chocolate leaves on as you remove them from the artificial leaves. (I use aluminum foil) Be careful not to hold a leaf any longer than necessary since chocolate does melt at body temperature.\u00a0 Pick up a hardened, chocolate covered leaf and turn it over (wire side up). Very carefully pick the corner of the leaf and GENTLY pull it away from the chocolate. The artificial leaf should come away from the chocolate, carefully continue to pull the leaf little by little until it have come completely off the leaf.\u00a0 I will warn you, the chocolate is delicate and you are going to break several leaves, but that is okay after all leaves crack and crumble in real life so these little pieces are useable. Once all of the chocolate has been peeled from the artificial leaves, it is time to make another batch. This is when you can change colors. I will reuse the same bowl without cleaning the previous color out so that some of my leaves will have a tint of another color in them. This gives the leaves a more realistic look.\u00a0 I made around 90 leaves, I had about 15 leaves left over after covering my cake, and lost about 15 more due to them breaking.\u00a0 Step 8: \"If You Presume to Love Something, You Must Love the Process of It Much More Than You Love the FINISHED PRODUCT.\" - John Irving. <PIC> Finally its time to put all the pieces together! You can now get your bunt cake. Generously apply icing to your cake, I recommend dyeing the icing orange or brown for a Thanksgiving cake and green for a Christmas cake. The icing is the \"glue\" that hold the leaves on the cake. Once the cake is iced completely you can start sticking leave to it. I randomly placed leaves where ever I wanted, though I did try to spread it out so that the orange leaves were evenly spread amongst the brown. After you feel you have completely covered the cake, take you acorns and apply a small amount of icing on the side you decide is the bottom. Again the icing is serving as your edible \"glue\", now decide where you want the acorns\u00a0 and place them there, icing side down. I would suggest only placing acorns on the top of your cake, while the icing is a \"glue\". Acorns stuck to the side will most likely fall off, possibly bringing leaves with it. After all this work the last thing you want it for your cake to deconstruct itself due to gravity.

{"id": "RECIPE_304", "question": "What is the process for creating a stunning color-changing cocktail that transitions from blue to purple?", "provenance": [40194], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Color-Changing Cocktails. <PIC> Blue foods are striking (and rare) all by themselves, but add a little lime juice and this emerald blue elixir will *magically* change into a brilliant purple. I've named my little cocktail the Indigo Blush. The intense color is completely natural (from a flower!) it's not difficult to make, and the color transformation is truly stunning. The basil/lime/gin flavor combination is bright, refreshing, and dangerously drinkable.\u00a0 If you're impatient and just want the recipe, go ahead and skip to the last step. Read on for my full, exhaustive treatise on color-changing foods. Some recipes start from an idea and just magically come together when the ingredients are in my hands. Others take years of fiddling, research, scrapping the whole idea and starting again, more fiddling, seeking expert advise,\u00a0 testing and retesting before satisfying results emerge. This recipe is definitely in the latter group. The idea of a color-changing recipe is one of those white whales I have been chasing for years, and finally, I have a dish I'm excited to share.\u00a0 When I first read about color changing food pigments I could barely contain my glee. I mean, think of the possibilities: a dish that can change COLORS? It turns out that lots of plants have pigment molecules that are pH indicators. In a neutral or basic solution they will appear green-blue or blue-purple, but add some acid and they'll turn purple or red. (You've probably seen examples of this already: blueberries in blueberry pancakes will sometimes turn green if the batter has too much baking soda, or brush your teeth with a baking soda toothpaste after drinking a glass of red wine and you'll end up with a mouthful of blue foam.)\u00a0 Lots of dishes get a little something acidic thrown in at the end, so it didn't seem like making a dish to use this color-change trick would be too difficult. My very first experiments quickly showed that I would need a mostly clear solution in order to show off the color change. (Opaque foods just muddied it up and got in the way). So I got to work trying out all sorts of ingredients with color-changing pigments: radicchio, red cabbage, blueberries. The findings of these tests were disappointing. Either the color would come out muddied and dull (blueberries) or the flavor would be horrid (red cabbage) or both (radicchio). And that's not even getting to the hardest part: acidity. Nearly everything that we eat is acidic. Egg whites and most tap water are slightly basic, but everything else is just varying degrees of acidity. For the color change to work, you need an acid addition that will significantly change the pH, but not until the dish is served. (So adding any acid to the mix beforehand is a no-go.) And this makes adding any flavor difficult. Just about every flavor-enhancing technique I thought of either muddied up the color or added acid. Perhaps, I thought, this is a phenomenon that works great in an eighth grade chemistry class, but really shouldn't be brought into the kitchen. And then I met this little blue flower. (Hello, butterfly blue pea flower!) It doesn't seem to have much of an audience in the US yet, but Thai and Chinese cooks have long used this little flower to color foods and make teas with a brilliant blue hue. For my money, this is truly a remarkable ingredient. For one thing, it's hard to overstate how brilliant the color from this flower is. The pigment is highly soluble-- you don't even have to boil it to release the color. And since the flowers can be dried, it is easy to keep them on hand. The only slight detractor is that they don't have any real flavor on their own. But even that negative can be a boon-- you could use these little guys to color any sort of dish, and add whatever flavors you want separately. Finally I had an ideal candidate to make a color-changing recipe, and I decided a fancy cocktail would be just the thing to showcase this remarkable little ingredient. I chose to make an alcoholic beverage, but there is no reason that the same techniques wouldn't work for non-alcoholic beverages.\u00a0 Step 1: The \"Secret\" Ingredient. <PIC> The first (and most difficult) part of making this drink will be getting your hands on some butterfly blue pea flowers. (Unless you happen to live in Thailand. Then it seems like it will be quite easy.) I have found the easiest way to get these guys is to order through amazon. Search for butterfly blue pea flowers in tea, and you'll find a few vendors that carry them. The catch is, they all ship from Thailand, and shipping to the US usually takes about a month. They aren't cheap (with shipping my order was around 20$), but the 50g. bag that I bought will definitely make around 5 bottles of color-changing liquor. And the dried flowers keep well, so you could get quite a lot of use out of an order. \u00a0While it isn't easy to get your hands on dried flowers in the US, it is fairly easy to get seeds. So the other option is to grow the plant yourself. I was so intrigued by this little flower, I decided to try my hand at growing some fresh ones in my backyard this year. I am by no means an expert gardener, but I can share a few tips that I've figured out from growing this little guy. (And, if we're being honest,\u00a0 killing off some other seedlings along the way) 1. Use a bean/pea innoculant when you start your seeds. I tried germinating two batches of seeds, one with innoculant and one without. I got a MUCH better germination rate (around 70%) with innoculant as compared to 33% without. 2. Heat, heat, heat. Unlike regular garden peas, these guys like it hot. I started some seedlings on a heating mat, which seemed to work. But my attempts to harden off plants to grow outside in colder temperatures (60-70s F) were not successful. The healthy plant that I grew was started indoors with lots of light, and I didn't move it outdoors until the temperature lows were in the 70s (mid-summer here in New York). You also want to plant them in well-drained soil, and don't over-water them. (This plant likes soil on the dry side.) 3. This plant has delicate roots and does not like being repotted. I would suggest starting seedlings in peat pots so you don't need to disturb the roots when transferring them to a container or the ground. 4. Give them a trellis or fence to climb on. Like other varieties of peas, this plant only seems to flower once it has reached a certain height. (Then the extending vines produce lots of flowers. ) 5. If you want to have enough blossoms to make a bottle of color-changing gin, you'll probably need several plants. I'm estimating that my single vine will produce about 2 dozen blossoms this year. That's not bad, but it would only make about a quarter of a bottle of liquor. The plants really are stunning, though. And the fresh flowers can be eaten and used as a garnish on all sorts of dishes. I'll definitely be planting them again next year.  Step 2: Elements of a Color-Changing Cocktail. <PIC> To create a color-changing cocktail I knew I would need a butterfly blue pea-infused liquor, and then an acidic addition to activate the color change. I also wanted to add some other flavors and a little sweetness to the cocktail. After a little poking around, I found out that most vodkas and gins have a neutral or near-neutral pH. I chose gin for my cocktail, but vodka would work just as well.\u00a0 Adding other flavors gets a little tricky-- it's hard to add anything into the mix without inadvertently adding acid. (And we want to save that for the dramatic finale.) I found that creating a syrup with fresh herbs did not add too much acidity, and could still bring lots of flavor with them. I chose to make a light syrup, (not that high of a sugar concentration) just because I don't like my drinks very sweet. I was going for flavor, with just enough sweetness to cut the harshness of the gin and balance the acid addition. I also found that infusing a hot syrup gently (rather than boiling it) will give you a syrup that is more clear. It's not totally colorless, but it's clear enough so the color-changing effect isn't noticeably diminished. The last element was the acid. I tried a number of combinations of floral and herbal syrups with different acids (including some interesting experiments with white balsamic vinegar and vermouth.) The clear favorite in the taste category was basil syrup with fresh lime juice. I'm sure that there are other winning combinations out there-- I anxiously await to hear more ideas from all you talented mixologists... The one caveat I would add is that you get the most dramatic color change effect when you add a strong, liquid acid. (I did some tests with powdered citric acid and frozen lime juice: meh.) The most satisfying display was with just plain lime juice. I specify straining the lime juice to try to keep the drink as clear as possible. Step 3: The Indigo Blush (My Recipe for a Color-Changing Cocktail). <PIC> Indigo Blush: 2 oz. Blue Gin 1 oz. Basil Lemongrass Syrup 1 oz. Strained Lime JuiceBlue Gin: \u00bd bottle dry gin 3-4 T dried butterfly blue pea flowers baking sodaBasil Syrup: 1 c. sugar 1 \u00bdc. thai basil (If you cannot get thai basil, just use italian basil and add 1-2 seeds of star anise. And just one prong off the star, not the whole thing.) 2 T sliced lemongrass 2 c. boiling waterFor Serving: Limes (1 oz. lime juice per serving) Fine-meshed strainer tea pot, creamer or other container to pour a small amount of lime juice into the finished drink. IceInfuse Gin One at a time, remove the green base leaves from the dried flowers, keeping just the colorful petals. Place the petals in a clean jar and cover with gin. You don\u2019t need to fill the jar up, just enough to cover the flowers.\u00a0 Stir to saturate the petals. Once they are softened, you can crush them lightly against the side of the jar. This will help speed up the dispersal of the color into the gin. Leave the mixture to sit for a day or two, until it turns very dark blue-purple. Strain out the petals and pour the concentrated color into a clean bottle. Pour in additional gin until it is diluted to your desired color intensity (remembering that the color will be dispersed more when it is mixed into a cocktail.) Most likely, the bottle of gin will have a purplish hue at this point. Add a \u00e2\u0085\u009bt. baking soda to the gin and shake to disperse. You can add more baking soda if it is necessary to nudge your gin into the blue range of the spectrum. But go slowly, and add just enough to get the job done. Add just a little and you'll never know it's there, but too much baking soda tastes terrible.\u00a0 The color tends to have a more purple appearance when you look through a greater depth. So hold the bottle to the side and look at the color of the gin at the edges to get a more accurate idea of what your gin will look like when it is poured into a cocktail. The infused gin can be made well in advance-- my color infused liquors have shown no signs of losing their brilliance after several weeks. (I'll update if there is any change in the shelf life of the colored gin, but the color seems quite stable.)Make Syrup Remove basil leaves from the stems and wash. Slice lemongrass as finely as you can. Lightly bruise the lemongrass under the flat side of your knife. Place sugar, lemongrass and basil leaves (and star anise, if you are using it) in a heat resistant container. Pour\u00a0 in 2c. boiling water and stir to dissolve. Cover the container and let it steep for several hours, until the mixture has cooled to room temperature.\u00a0 Strain the syrup and refrigerate. (Refrigerated syrup will keep for up to two weeks.)Mix Cocktail Juice a few limes and pour the juice through a fine-meshed tea strainer or coffee filter. You want this liquid to be as clear as possible to give the finished cocktail its gem-like brilliance.\u00a0 Measure two ounces of blue gin and one ounce of syrup. Is the color still a nice blue? If so, just charge ahead. If it has edged towards the purple spectrum with the addition of the syrup, you might need to add just a pinch of baking soda to push the pH back toward neutral. Again, go slow, and make sure not to overdo the baking soda. Shake in a cocktail shaker and pour into a martini glass. To complete the cocktail slowly pour 1 oz. of strained lime juice into the glass. (This would be the recommended moment to stop for a few minutes to bask in the the oohs and ahs.)Tips for Cocktail Brilliance. Since the color is the star of this show, it really pays to have a white background. (It is much harder to see the color change against a dark background or competing colors.) A white tablecloth or plate underneath the drinks works wonders. If you have enough flowers, you can make the drink as intensely blue as you want. BUT I find that you lose some of the brilliance of the color if it is very highly concentrated. When the drink changes colors it will also appear to lighten. So expect that your finished purple drink will look lighter than the initial blue base.", "images_list": ["color-changing-cocktails_0", "color-changing-cocktails_1", "color-changing-cocktails_2", "color-changing-cocktails_3"]}

{"id": "RECIPE_317", "question": "What is the best way to prepare a delightful malt loaf using a breadmaker?", "provenance": [40203], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Superior Soreen - Breadmaker Malt Loaf. <PIC> I love Soreen malt loaf, but since acquiring a breadmaking machine I prefer to bake my own bread.  I couldn't find a breadmaker recipe anywhere for a traditional northern malt loaf, so I experimented to produce my own.  For those unfortunate enough never to have tasted malt loaf, it's a sweetish, malt-flavoured tea bread that is full of dried fruit.  A buttered slice is a classic teatime treat in the north of England, but it's also delicious toasted and spread with jam for breakfast or as a late night snack.  Since devising a recipe that works in a breadmaker I can have freshly made, mostly wholemeal, malt loaf whenever I want it, but without the Soreen ingredients I'd rather avoid (like palm oil and preservatives).  Eaten in moderation, it's an excellent way of getting goodness-rich foods such as extract of malt, dried fruit, milk and wholemeal flour into children. If you use soya milk or another plant-based milk, it's suitable for vegans.I use a Panasonic breadmaker which has a \"speciality raisin\" programme.  You may need to make a few trial loaves tweaking the quantities of liquid a little each time, especially if you have a different brand of machine, until you end up with the texture you like.  Some people prefer a sticky, squidgy texture, others a drier, firmer loaf that is more like an ordinary loaf of bread.  The measurements below are a mix of Imperial (UK) and metric, but I've given some rough US conversions for the milk and water.  Actually, the precise quantities aren't too important, so much depends on things such as how dry the flour is, how accurately you can measure a spoonful of malt or treacle, the baking temperature of your breadmaker and your personal preference as to the final loaf texture.  So give it a try, making notes on how much of everything you used, and be prepared to make adjustments to get the result you want.  Ingredients1 teaspoon (5 ml) fast-acting dried yeast (the type meant for using in breadmakers)   6oz sultanas or plump raisins (or a mix)    12 oz strong wholemeal flour    6oz strong white flour    2 tablespoons (30 ml) vegetable oil (eg sunflower or olive)    1 dessertspoon malt extract    1 dessertspoon black treacle    300 ml (about 10 US fluid oz) semi-skimmed milk, or soya milk    100 ml (about 3.5 US fluid oz) water Step 1: Loading the Breadmaker. <PIC> Mix the two flours together.  Place the yeast first into the breadmaker's pan in a little heap on one side.  Then add all the other dry ingredients except for the fruit, on top.  Finally, add the liquid ingredients on the opposite side of the pan to the yeast - the aim is to keep the yeast dry for as long as possible.  If your breadmaker has a separate dispenser for fruit and nuts then put the sultanas or raisins in there, otherwise keep them back for now.  For breadmakers that can bake different sizes of loaf, choose the size setting that is most appropriate for the quantities you're using.  For  my Panasonic, that's XL.Set the breadmaker going on the \"speciality raisin\" programme, or whatever other programme your machine may have that is intended for fruit breads. If you need to add the dried fruit manually then set a timer to remind you, in case you aren't anywhere nearby when the breadmaker starts beeping.  For a machine that doesn't tell you when to put in the fruit, do it shortly before the end of the kneading/mixing phase, before the rising phase starts.  You want the fruit to be well mixed in, but not chopped up by excessive kneading.Don't be dismayed if the dough seems very sticky when you lift the lid and peer in before baking starts.  That's how it should be.   Step 2: After Baking. <PIC> When the programme finishes, remove the loaf quickly or it might become soggy.  Leave it to cool on a wire rack.When you cut the first slice, check to see whether the dried fruit is evenly distributed throughout the loaf.  Has it all sunk to the bottom?  If so, try with a little less milk and water the next time.  Or a different type of fruit.  Similarly, if the malt loaf is too sticky, or too soft to be able to cut it easily, the remedy is to use less liquid in the mix.  But a malt loaf is meant to be somewhat squidgy.   Step 3: How to Serve It. <PIC> I think slices of malt loaf are best toasted.  The outside will crisp up and caramelise a little while the inside stays slightly chewy. If you then butter it or cover it in jam while it's still hot, the result is utterly delicious.  Actually, you don't really need to spread anything on malt loaf because it should be quite moist and sweet enough to eat on its own.  Try half a (naked) slice with a cup of tea or in a lunchbox instead of a biscuit.  Or spread on a generous amount of butter, as you would do with parkin, another northern speciality.

I was so bummed at the idea of an entire loaf being useless, so I determined to use it up somehow. It didn't take long for me to decide that this bread was perfect for eggs in a basket (or popeye toast as many people call it). But I had already had my heart set on eggs Benedict... after a moment of deliberation I resolved to combine the two, and I have to say I was quite pleased with the outcome.  Step 1: Ingredients. Most of the ingredients you'll probably have on hand, which makes this a good lazy morning breakfast. You need:Bread; one or two slices per personEggs; depending on the hole you make in the bread, one or two per sliceButter; 1/2 Tbsp per egg plus a little more for toasting and saut\u00e9ing Mushrooms; as many as you wantLemon Juice; 1/4 tsp per eggGarlicPaprikaSaltNote: the lemon juice and butter are for making hollandaise sauce, if you prefer a mix or another recipe then go for it, but I prefer to make it myself.  Step 2: Make the Toast . <PIC> Slice your pre-holed bread, or rip out the middle of some normal slices. Butter and toast one side in a pan and separate the eggs and yolks while it's toasting (unless you're not making your hollandaise sauce from scratch, then you can leave them together). When it's good and toasted to your liking, butter the other side and flip it over. Immediately pour the egg whites in the center and allow it to cook through. While that's going, dice the garlic and chop the onions. Heat up a pan of butter and saut\u00e9 the garlic and mushrooms. Cover(so it stays warm) and set aside. At this point, the egg should be just about cooked (if it's not then flip it over for about 30 seconds with a spatula). Remove from the heat and also cover. Now time to make the sauce. There are many recipes, they are all similar. And mine goes like this: melt the butter(1/2 Tbsp per yolk), use a double boiler if you have one. If not, get creative; I use a ceramic bowl in a small pot with a little water in the bottom. A microwave is fine for melting the butter, but you'll need something else once you add the eggs. Once it's all melted add the egg yolks and beat vigorously with a wisk, be careful not to cook them to the point of scrambling. When the eggs and butter are well combined, add the lemon juice, salt to taste, and a little sprinkle of paprika. Continue whisking until the sauce is light yellow and about double in volume from when you first added the yolks.  Step 3: Put It All Together. <PIC> Place your pieces of toast on a plate, add salt and pepper to taste, drizzle with sauce (or smother if you like), and top with the saut\u00e9ed garlic and mushrooms. If you want you can add a few other things like tomato slices, dried herbs of your choice (basil, oregano, or cilantro would be good), fruit, or slices of cheese. Feel free to change it up as you like, but this meal is best enjoyed hot, so dig in! Thanks for reading and I hope you love this delectable dish as much as I did.

I used bite sized snicker bars, Recees Peanut butter cups, and Ferro Roche candies. Peanut M&Ms, caramels, nuts, dried fruits, mixed chocolates, etc. will all work great. This is where you have a lot of room to play with your balls.\nBasically we will make a thick chocolate shell and fill it with a chocolate hazelnut filling embedded with other candies.\nLarge Microwavable Bowl\nSpoon\nMetal Spatula/ Pancake turner\nSterilite Christmas Bulb Storage tray to use as a mold Step 1: Melting the Chocolate. <PIC> Break up 1 bar of the Dark chocolate and place in bowl.

Chocolate should be starting to melt now. Keep microwaving and stirring until chocolate is melted and smooth. When it really starts melting, reduce microwave times to 10 seconds. Chocolate should be thick but pourable off a spoon. Step 2: Filling Your Depression With Chocolate. <PIC> Spoon chocolate into depressions on tray. Spoon it thicker around the top edge of the depression. The chocolate needs to be thick to build up a shell. Cover all of the bottom of the depression with chocolate. Pop into the freezer until set.\nRemove from freezer. Repeat previous steps of melting chocolate and filling the depression. Freeze.\nRemove from freezer. By now there should be a fairly thick shell that covers the whole depression. If not repeat a third time.\nThe freezer will make the outsides of the balls shiny. We all know that Schweddy Balls glisten. Step 3: Schweddy Ball Fillings. <PIC> Make you added candies bite size. You want decent sized pieces but small enough where they will fit without sticking above the mold depressions. I used snickers, Reccees cups, and Ferrero Roche. So I ended up with three different balls.\nMelt the 72% Cacao Dark Chocolate the same way as the previous steps. You can use the same bowl and any other chocolate that was left. When melted, add about half to \u00be of the jar of Nuttella. Stir together until well combined.\nAdd Nuttella/chocolate filling and candy pieces to each of the ball halves. Make sure too try to not overfill the ball halves. Pop in freezer till setup fully. Step 4: Finishing Off Schweddy Balls. <PIC> Take the metal spatula and scrape the tops of the filled depressions to perfectly level off the halves. You are basically \u201cplaning\u201d the chocolate halves. The halves should pop right out of the molds.\nTake two of the halves and \u201cglue\u201d together with more of the Nuttella/Chocolate mixture. This should still be semi liquid. It will set up but it takes much longer then the balls in the freezer.\nA more ambitious person would decorated their balls or dip the balls in another chocolate.

If you haven't watched it, watch it and see why it's so special.  To me, it looks like something you would see at Mad Hatter's tea party.  It's colorful, dainty and it looks like it's about to tip over.This recipe makes about 14 pieces.  You could halve the recipe if it's way too much.  I would suggest that you make the cream puff and chocolate custard first then decorate the next day unless you want to spend your whole day in the kitchen.  This is a rich and decadent treat.  It's something I would make for a very special occasion or anniversary.  Anybody who would receive this would certainly feel the love. Step 1: Ingredients. Chocolate Custard 2 1/2 cups full cream milk80 dark chocolate bar5 egg yolks3/4 cup sugar2/3 cup all purpose flour3 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder2 tablespoons unsalted butter1 tablespoon vanilla extractCream Puffs1 cup sifted all purpose flour1 cup water4 tablespoons unsalted butter1/4 teaspoon salt4 eggsWhite Chocolate Frosting375 grams white chocolate ( I used a pack of Nestle melts)Food colour gel (red, green, purple) (I used blue since I can't find purple in my supermarket)Butter Cream Frosting 125 grams unsalted butter1 1/2 cups powdered sugar1 Tablespoon milkChocolate Covered Almonds14 pcs AlmondsDark chocolate barFilligree DesignWhite chocolate writing icing tube Step 2: Chocolate Custard (Filling). <PIC> Separate the whites and yolk from 5 eggs.  For the custard we will only be using the yolks.  Place them in a bowl and add the sugar.  Whisk the mixture. Sift the all purpose flour and cocoa powder and add that to the egg mixture and whisk until it is well combined. In a saucepan, heat the milk and dark chocolate in moderate heat.  When the chocolate is melted and bubbles appear on the edge of the pan, add this to the egg and flour mixture in a bowl and whisk.  When it is mixed well, place it back to the saucepan in moderate heat mixing constantly with a wooden spoon until it thickens.When the custard has thickened, remove from the heat and add in the butter and vanilla extract and mix well.  Then place the custard in a container and place a saran wrap directly on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from developing.  Then cool it in the refrigerator. Step 3: Cream Puffs. <PIC> For the cream puff, sift the flour and set it aside.  In a sauce pan, boil a cup of water with butter and salt.  Once it's boiling, add in the flour all at once and mix with a wooden spoon.  When the mixture pulls from the sides of the pan and has formed into a ball, remove from the heat.  Add one egg at a time mixing the mixture until the egg is incorporated well before adding in another egg.  After the fourth egg, you can see in the 4th image that it has become glossy and the consistency is similar to thick custard.  Let this cool for 5 minutes.On a parchment covered tray, pipe the mixture using a round tip to 3 sizes (large, medium, small).  I just eyeballed mine from the largest one about golf ball sized and the smallest one approximately marble sized.  I baked the large and medium ones in the same tray while the small puffs in another tray since they will come out of the oven sooner.Bake them in a pre-heated oven 200 degrees celsius for 15 minutes then lower the temperature to 160 degrees then let it cool in the oven to make sure they don't sink.  For the small puffs, they will also bake for 200 degrees for 15 minutes but only 10 minutes for 160 degrees and you can remove them immediately from the oven.Once removed from the oven, place them on a wire rack and make holes under the puffs using a small knife to make sure the moisture comes out. Step 4: White Chocolate Frosting. <PIC> When the puffs are cooled, pipe in the chocolate custard in the hole and set aside. For the frosting, melt the white chocolate on a double boiler.  Place them in 3 bowls and add food color for each. (red, green, blue) In the movie, the largest puff is purple but I can't find it in the supermarket so I used blue. Dip the small puffs in red, the medium puffs in green and the large puffs in blue.  Step 5: Chocolate Covered Almonds and Butter Cream Frosting. <PIC> Melt some dark chocolate on a double boiler then dip the almonds and let it set on parchment paper.  For the butter cream frosting, use a mixer and mix until the butter is light and fluffy then add the sifted powdered sugar a little at a time while mixing plus the milk. (Instead of using butter cream frosting, you can use whipped cream.  I think whipped cream is better so that it isn't too sweet.)  Take some butter cream frosting and color it blue.  Since my frosting is yellow due to the butter , it turned out green. Step 6: Assembling and Decorating. <PIC> Instead of placing some butter cream frosting on top of each cream puff, I recommend that you use melted white chocolate to make the bond between each puff stronger because mine kept on slipping.Using a white chocolate piping tube, make some filligree designs for each puff.Add a collar of green dots in between cream puffs.Use a star tip, pipe the butter cream frosting design along the base of the pastry.Add some frosting to the top and place the chocolate covered almond.Then, 13 more to go. ^_^", "images_list": ["mendls-courtesan-au-chocolat_0", "mendls-courtesan-au-chocolat_2", "mendls-courtesan-au-chocolat_3", "mendls-courtesan-au-chocolat_4", "mendls-courtesan-au-chocolat_5", "mendls-courtesan-au-chocolat_6"]}

Then, add a little at a time of this dry mixture to the wet mixture. Combine together gently.\n5) Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar in a separate bowl until the eggs whites form soft peaks. Add egg whites gradually into the rest of the batter and fold in gently.\n6) Divide the cupcake batter evenly into the cupcake pan. Bake for 25 minutes (or until a toothpick comes out clean). Remove from the oven let them cool. Remove the cupcakes from the pan and let them continue to cool completely. Step 3: Coconut Cream Filling. <PIC> This Coconut Cream Filling is for piping inside the cupcakes.\n1) Pour the whipping cream into a bowl and beat until it becomes thick and fluffy (about 5 minutes).\n2) Add the coconut and sugar and mix together. If you are using sweetened coconut you may not feel the need to add any sugar. Either way, there will be plenty of sugar later in the butter cream icing! Set in the fridge to keep chilled if you are not yet ready to fill the cupcakes.\u00a0\n3) Using a wooden skewer, poke a hole in the center of the cooked cupcakes, about 2/3 of the way in. Move the skewer around in a circle to dig a little \"well\" in the middle of the cupcake.\u00a0\n4) Spoon the Coconut Cream into a piping bag with a small narrow tip. Place the tip into the hole in the cupcake and gently squeeze the bag until the Coconut Cream fills up the hole in the cupcake and you can see that it is filled to the top. Step 4: Pina Colada Butter Cream. <PIC> 1) Add the butter and half the icing sugar into a bowl and beat well until thick and creamy.\n2) Add the rest of the icing sugar slowly in small batches and continue to mix until well blended. (You can add less or more icing sugar to your taste). Add the Pina Colada Mix and mix until well combined. Store in refridgerator if you are not yet ready to decorate your cupcakes.\u00a0 Step 5: Decorating. <PIC> To decorate the cupcakes I used the biggest \"Open Star\" tip in my piping set but feel free to use any tip you desire. You can also, of course, just use a knife and spread the icing smooth over the tops of the cupcakes. And they would still look and taste great!\nTo make what I have coined the \"Swirly Star\" pattern, start on the outermost edge of the cupcake and slowly squeeze, making a large swirl until you reach the center of the cupcake. Squeeze while pressing down firmly in the center of the cupcake and then slowly lift your piping tip away from the cupcake. \u00a0It might take a bit of practice but you can always scrape it off the cupcake back into the piping bag and try again!\u00a0I apologize for there being no pictures of the piping process but I needed both hands for piping.\nPlace a small slice of a pineapple ring on the edge of the cupcake. Poke the umbrella through a maraschino cherry. Gently press the umbrella with the cherry into the cupcake next to the pineapple slice. Sprinkle the cupcake with shredded coconut.\u00a0ENJOY YOUR TASTE OF TROPICAL CUPCAKE PARADISE!", "images_list": ["pina-colada-cupcakes-2_0", "pina-colada-cupcakes-2_1", "pina-colada-cupcakes-2_2", "pina-colada-cupcakes-2_3", "pina-colada-cupcakes-2_4", "pina-colada-cupcakes-2_5"]}

This no-bake vegan cheesecake itself is very creamy, delicious, has no cashews in it & is super addictive too. MMM! Can I serve you a yummy piece?ou can really taste the yummy coconut butter in here & at the top the yummy juicy clementines & home-made drizzled chocolate sauce! The cheesecake it self is not too sweet just sweet enough! Enjoy! xxxxHere is the tart coming out of the cheesecake tin & bottom: A thing of beauty! ;) Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients!. Recipe: For 1 cheesecake tin: 18 cm x 18 cmIngredients:For the cheesecake base: 1 cup (85 gr) medium-sized oats 1 cup (85 gr) white almond meal 2 tablespoons melted coconut oil 3 tablespoons maple syrup For the cheesecake itself:1 packet of 400 gr drained silken tofu 50 gr coconut cream 1 cup coconut butter  (I added 1 teaspoon of coconut oil) 2 tablespoons coconut sugar 2 tablespoons maple syrup 1 teaspoon xantan gum 1 teaspoon vanilla extract/ I use home-made 1 tablespoon unsweetened soy milk 2 peeled clementines, pits removed For the clementines on top: 3-4 clementines, peeled, pits removed, cut up not segments For the Chocolate Drizzle: 2 tablespoons coconut oil, warmed until melted 2 tablespoons maple syrup 2 tablespoons raw, unsweetened, natural cacao powder Step 2: Method!. <PIC> First, make the base. Take your food processor & place the S-blade in.  Add oats. Place fitted lid on & pulse until it resembles a flour. Add almond flour, melted coconut oil & maple syrup. Place fitted lid on & pulse until it forms a brownish dough. It will look something like this. See 1st picture above!Oil your cheesecake tin with the same coconut oil on the base & sides. With help of your fingers & hands, push the dough into all the sides & base of the cheesecake tin. You can use the back of a spoon or spatula to help you. Place into the fridge to stiff up, at least until your filling is made. It will look something like this, see 2nd picture above!Now, make the cheesecake topping. Take your Vitamix container & add silken tofu, coconut cream, coconut butter, coconut sugar, maple syrup, xantan gum, vanilla, soy milk & clementines together. Place fitted lid on & use the tamper to push ingredients into the running blades. Blend on high-speed for 1 to 2 minutes & turn back. Stop machine from time to time to push ingredients into the blades. Blend again on high-speed until it all is creamy & check the sweetness. You must taste the clementines with sweetness attached! ;) It will be creamy & very thick too. Spread it all out on top of your cooled base. With help of a spatula, clean fingers & a spoon. Place back into the fridge for at least 2 hours or until stiffed up. After being one hour in the fridge, place fresh segments of clementines over the top of the cheesecake & place back into the fridge, see picture here, 3rd picture above!Finally, make the drizzled chocolate sauce. Place your coconut oil, raw cacao powder & maple syrup into a bowl above a fitted pot filled with boiling water. The hot water must not touch the bowl! This is called au-bain-marie. Set the what on low-heat. The heat will melt your coconut oil & with a whisk, stir everything together! MMM! You can really taste the chocolate & yummy maple syrup. See 4th & 5th pictures above!Turn heat off & drizzle your hot chocolate sauce over your clementine segments & place into the fridge to cool down further, at least for 4 hours!!! I drizzled my chocolate sauce with a spoon but that wasn\u2019t very handy though! See 6th picture above!When you think your cheesecake is ready, take it out of your fridge. With help of your hands, carefully flip your cheesecake tin open. Take away your upstanding sides. With help of a sharp long knife, loosen the base of your cheesecake carefully. Now, take a clean large plate or tart presentation stand & move your cheesecake to there, very slowly. Cut into desired pieces, but not too large because this cheesecake will fill you up! Enjoy with loved one\u2019s! MMMM! Place leftovers into a fitted pot with fitted lid in the fridge. Remove from the fridge about 15 minutes before serving, because you want the cheesecake to be creamy & not too cold!!! :)You can also find this tasty recipe here on my blog: http://sophiesfoodiefiles.wordpress.com/2015/11/13/vegan-no-bake-clementine-cheesecake/", "images_list": ["vegan-no-bake-clementine-cheesecake_0", "vegan-no-bake-clementine-cheesecake_2"]}

Step 1: Tools and Materials. <PIC> \n          First, you must gather the proper supplies. \u00a0The trickiest part of this recipe is getting the proper tea leaves. \u00a0This may involve a trip to your local Indian market. \u00a0The key is to ask for \"CTC leaf\". \u00a0CTC stands for \"Cut, Torn, Crushed\" and is a concentrated, processed tea leaf. \u00a0You could try and make this from loose leaf Darjeeling or something fancy, but Masala Chai isn't really that kind of thing. \u00a0It comes in a bag and looks like coffee grounds. The MOST important thing isn't what is on this list, but what is NOT on this list. \u00a0Resist the urge to through all the spices in your spice cabinet into this tea (i.e., no nutmeg, cinnamon, lemongrass, cloves, allspice, etc.) \u00a0Of course after you've had the authentic chai experience, go ahead... but I strongly suggest you make it simply at least once to see how good it is.   2 cups of milk     2 cups of water     3 tablespoons of sugar     6-7 cardamom pods (I suggest buying these in bulk at your local health food store)     4 teaspoons of CTC leaf indian tea     something to strain the tea with  Step 2: The Boil. <PIC> In a large saucepan, put 2 cups water, 2 cups milk, 3 Tbsp of sugar over low to medium heat.

Stir this mixture to dissolve the sugar, and bring it to a boil. \u00a0Be careful because it really likes to boil over. \u00a0It's ok if it does a little bit, I'm convinced it makes the tea more authentic. :) Step 3: The Tea. <PIC> Once the sugar/cardamom/water/milk mixture is boiling, then it is time to add the 4 teaspoons of CTC leaf tea. After adding the tea, you boil it for several minutes until it gets that \"chai color\" as shown below.

{"id": "RECIPE_377", "question": "What\u2019s the best way to create delicious divinity chews that surprise your family during the holidays?", "provenance": [40244], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Divinity Chew Candies. <PIC> Look, making candy is hard. But in light of that, I attempted to make divinity candy this year to take to my family get together using my grandmother's recipe. What ended up happening? I messed up. I got my mess-up on camera since I was making an Instructable for divinity. Alas, you get this!The StoryI don't usually use a candy thermometer and have always had divinity turn out well. This time, the sugar syrup mixture got a little too hot. The result was...not divinity. However, it did taste like divinity! Instead of being white and fluffy, it was tan and chewy. As disappointed as I was, what I got out of this mess-up was sort of a \"Divinity Chew\", kind of like a taffy with a divinity taste to it. This is a traditional candy turned into something new. In fact, I decided to cut them into little pieces, wrap them in wax paper, and hand little boxes of them out to the family on Christmas Eve.In giving the boxes out, I opted to not tell the family that I meant to make divinity and ended up with a chewy thing instead. When asked, I urged them to try it first, then tell them the story.There seemed to be a common theme in the response I got: \"You might be on to something with this!\"Enjoy! Step 1: Gather Ingredients and Materials. <PIC> I used my grandmother's recipe, which has been copied by my mother and appears to leave out how much vanilla is needed, but a credible source (my mom), has told me it's 1 teaspoon. After making this recipe and getting my \"Divinity Chews\" I was also told some steps were left out because my grandmother made it from a recipe in her head and apparently missed a couple while transferring it to paper. Nevertheless, here's what I used.Ingredients needed:3 cups white sugar 3/4 cups white karo syrup 3 egg whites 3/4 cups water 1 teaspoon vanilla Pecans, shelled and crushed into piecesMaterials needed:Nut cracker (if using in-shell pecans) Stand mixer (to whip egg whites) Candy thermometer (optional) Cookie sheet, butteredWaxed paperThe recipeSo if you've checked out the recipe, it's pretty confusing. She never used a candy thermometer and relied only on what the sugar did when you dropped it into cold water. I'm not going to be using a candy thermometer either, so in the next step, I'll review the stages sugar goes through when boiled. Step 2: Soft-Ball to Hard-Crack: Stages of Candy-Making. When you mix sugar syrup and water and heat, the water boils out. The mixture of heat and water loss is what gets you to the correct stage of candy hardness for the appropriate type of candy you're making. For instance, I sometimes make \"no-bake cookies\" and boil sugar and water for a minute and a half and they harden up just right even without testing the hardness of the sugar beforehand. However, my boyfriend has never had them come out right - my guess is that he doesn't boil the sugar long enough!Stages of SugarSoft-Ball StageThe sugar for no-bake cookies is boiled until it reaches the Soft-Ball Stage. At this stage, the mixture ranges from 235\u00b0 F\u2013240\u00b0 F and has a sugar concentration of 85%. In the absence of a candy thermometer, when you drop some of the sugar syrup into cold water, it will form a ball that, when removed by hand, will flatten.Firm-Ball StageEver made caramel? You probably cooked the sugar until it reaches the Firm-Ball Stage. We'll be using this stage for this recipe too. The mixture is now 245\u00b0 F\u2013250\u00b0 F and the sugar concentration has raised 2% to 87%. A ball will still form when dropped in cold water, but when removed, it will not flatten until squeezed. In this recipe, when it first mentions hard ball, it actually means this stage, as some of the mixture will be cooked longer until it reaches the next stage.Hard-Ball StageFor this recipe, we're looking to get to the Hard-Ball Stage. Once past the firm-ball stage, there's a little more leeway on temperature range: 250\u00b0 F\u2013265\u00b0 F. The sugar concentration is up to 92% at this point, so when the sugar drips from the spoon into the cold water, it does so in thick strands. Once in water, it forms a hard ball that doesn't flatten when picked up unless you really squish it. This stage is what is referred to in the recipe when it says \"until it bounces off the table\".Crack StagesPast the ball stages, you reach the Soft-Crack and the Hard-Crack Stages. During the Soft-Crack Stage, the temperature is between 270\u00b0 F\u2013290\u00b0 F and the sugar concentration is 95%. In cold water, the syrup will form threads that will bend before breaking. The Soft-Crack Stage is what my sugar syrup mixture ended as. During the Hard-Crack Stage, the temperature is between 300\u00b0 F\u2013310\u00b0 F and the sugar concentration is 99%. In cold water, the syrup forms threads that break when bent.Higher TempsAnything past the above stage will get you caramelized (brown liquid) sugar, where all of the water has evaporated. I won't be talking about these here. Now to begin! Step 3: Prepare the Eggs and Pecans. <PIC> PecansGoing with tradition, I used whole pecans. My family had an overabundance of them this year, but usually I just use pecans which have already been shelled. If I had to guess, I used about a cup of shelled pecans, which was probably about 1/3 cup of crushed pecans. I would have liked more, so feel free to put in pecans until your heart's content (or none at all if you prefer).Set these aside for later.EggsSeparate the whites from the yolks on all 3 eggs and put the whites in the mixing bowl.Break out that stand mixer (or a hand mixer and buff arms) and whip the egg whites until they are stiff. Mine got super stiff, but were not over beaten. Step 4: Sugar Syrup Mixture. <PIC> Add the sugar, karo syrup, and water in a saucer and set to high. As it heats up, stir it so it mixes together.Now, \u266alet it boil, let it boil, let it boil\u266aPart 1If you're being safe and using a candy thermometer (probably a good idea), heat the mixture until it reaches 245\u00b0 F\u2013250\u00b0 F, the Firm-Ball Stage. If not using a candy thermometer, you should test occasionally by dropping some of the mixture into a glass of cold water until it makes the firm ball. Remember, the sugar syrup will make a ball, but will flatten when squished. At this point, very slowly pour HALF of the sugar syrup into the mixing bowl with the egg whites while mixing on a lower setting. Pouring too fast will make the whites cook! Keep the mixer on while going to Part 2.Put the remaining mixture back on the burner.Part 2Now heat the mixture until the candy thermometer reaches 265\u00b0 F\u2013290\u00b0 F, the Hard-Ball to Soft-Crack Stage, or when you drop some sugar syrup into cold water and it will be a hard ball and solidify into threads that will bend before breaking. My mixture I believe was either between these two stages or just going to the Soft-Crack Stage because it formed a hard ball when in water, but when I took it off the burner, it was a tan color.Once again, very slowly pour the mixture into the egg white/sugar syrup mixture while the mixer is on a low speed. ---------------------WARNING: The mixture is EXTREMELY HOT. Do not have the mixer on a high speed or it might splash back up at you. Be very careful when pouring the sugar syrup at any stage!!---------------------After pouring the remaining mixture, turn the mixer to a higher speed. After about one minute, turn off the mixer, remove what you can from the whisk, and very carefully remove the mixing bowl. Put the bowl on a pot holder. Step 5: Add Vanilla, Pecans and Spoon. <PIC> Add your 1 teaspoon of vanilla and your pecans (if you choose to use them) and mix well. Now you potentially have 2 options. Option 1 (how I did it)Spoon the mixture on to buttered cookie sheets. You might need to use another spoon to scoop the mixture out in cookie-sized pieces.Once cooled, use kitchen shears to cut each piece into bite-sized chunks.Option 2You might want to take a somewhat easier route without two spoons. Pour the divinity mixture on to a buttered cookie sheet or two so it forms a large puddle. Let it cool and then use kitchen shears or some other shard device (maybe a pizza cutter?) to cut it up into small pieces. Step 6: Wrap and Serve. <PIC> Cut squares of waxed paper and wrap each piece individually. I ended up with about 130 pieces, which I stuffed into small 3\" x 3\" x 2\" gift boxes.At Christmas before our unwrapping \"ceremony\", I handed them out to my family and got good reviews. They taste like divinity, but have the texture of a taffy. My aunt admitted that she isn't a fan of the texture of traditional divinity, but that these \"chews\" are much better for her.All in all, I was able to salvage my failure into a success! I managed to take a traditional candy and make it \"modern\" according to one family member.Luckily for you I recorded my failure and now you too can make these yummy holiday candies!", "images_list": ["divinity-chews_0", "divinity-chews_1", "divinity-chews_3", "divinity-chews_4", "divinity-chews_5", "divinity-chews_6"]}

I add red pepper and frozen corn instead of canned corn for an improved flavor and texture.  Step 1: Ingredients. 12oz Package Salt Pork1 Small Onion3 Medium Yellow potatoes1 Large Red Bell Pepper1 lb Frozen Sweet Corn2 14.75 oz Cans Cream Corn1 qt Light Cream1 pint Heavy Cream2-4 shakes Tabasco Sauce1/8 tsp White PepperKosher Salt1/2 tsp Garlic Powder1 Bay leafFlourPinch of Cayenne Step 2: Prepare Mise En Place. <PIC> I start by chopping my vegetables and end with the salt pork. Dice the onion to about 1/4 inch, the potatoes to about 1/2 inch and the red pepper somewhere in between 1/4 and 1/2 inch. There is a thick part of skin on the slat pork that needs to be removed and discarded. Make a small slit between the meaty part and the skin and being careful not to slice to deep into the soft fat or your finger. Slice and then dice the pork to around 1/4 inch pieces.  Step 3: Start Cooking. <PIC> Place an 8 qt stock pot over medium heat and allow the pot to get hot before adding anything, this helps prevent sticking. Cook the salt pork over medium heat until the fat starts to form bubbles, about 15 minutes. You will want the meaty bits to start to get a little crispy.Next add the onions and stir frequently until they soften, about 3-4 minutes. Then add the potatoes with a pinch of salt, pepper and garlic powder. Turn the heat up to medium high and stir frequently until the potatoes just begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Add the red pepper, stir frequently until the peppers get soft making sure to scrape any bit that might stick to the bottom of the pan, about 3-4 minutes.Note: We prefer to have soft potatoes in my chowders however if you desire to have them a little firmer then add the red peppers in at the same time as the potatoes. We also like to have a little crunch left in the red pepper again adjust the cooking time according to your personal taste and consider cutting them a little smaller.At this point add flour a tablespoon at a time thoroughly mixing and cooking after each addition. Continue until all the ingredients start to bind together in clumps.  Step 4: Continue Cooking. <PIC> Once everything has clumped together it is time to add the rest of the ingredients. Add the cream corn, frozen corn, both creams, Tabasco, bay leaf, white pepper and garlic powder. Stir occasionally until small bubbles start to form on the top as pictured above, about 15-20 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer covered for 45 minutes to an hour depending on how thick you like chowder. Continue to stir occasionally during the simmer.Note: Add more Tabasco and/or some cayenne pepper if you want a little more spice. The amount  I add is suited for other members of my family who do not like spice. Also Limit any additional salt as the salt pork is pretty salty I really only add it when the potatoes go in mostly because not seasoning potatoes just seems wrong to me.  Step 5: Serve and Enjoy. <PIC> We like to serve this with corn bread. I like to add some fresh sliced jalapeno or Serrano peppers to spice it up a little.

You'll need:\n- a pot full of boiling water\n- a bowl full of ice water, and more ice to add as needed\n- a slotted spoon\n- a sharp knife\n- lots of beautiful fresh tomatoes! \u00a0\nI got these Early Girls from my favorite tomato growers,\u00a0Wild Boar Farms. \u00a0Soon they'll have tons of gorgeous and amazingly delicious heirloom tomatoes at the market, but I prefer to roast and freeze those, and their skins are so thin they don't require peeling. If you don't live in the SF bay area, I highly recommend buying some of their seeds so you can grow your own. Step 2: Staging (set Up Your System). <PIC> - Fill a medium to large-sized pot with water, cover, and crank the heat so it comes to a boil quickly and efficiently.\nWhile you're waiting for the water to boil:\n- Fill a medium to large-sized bowl half-full with ice, then cover with water. \u00a0Place it near the stove, but not so close it heats up from the boiling water.\n- Wash your tomatoes, and remove stems.\n- Make a small X in the skin at the flower end (opposite the stem) and place near the stove. (see photo for detail)\nCheck out my staging choices in the picture below, then modify as needed to suit your situation. Step 3: Boil Tomatoes. <PIC> Dump tomatoes into boiling water, and cook for roughly 30-45 seconds. \u00a0(Start counting time immediately - no need to wait for the water to reboil.)\nThis time will vary according to the size of your tomatoes (smaller tomatoes will cook faster!), the size of your pot (larger quantities of water have greater thermal mass!), and the number of tomatoes you drop in each time (more thermal mass of tomatoes drops the water temperature!).\nThe goal is to boil the tomatoes just long enough to cook the outer millimeter or so of tomato skin and connective tissue so the skin will detach easily, while leaving most of the tomato in a nearly-raw state. Do some test runs, and adjust your timing as needed. \u00a0If you see the tomato skins starting to split down from your original cut, they're definitely done - yank them out immediately, and consider dropping the time for your next batch. Step 4: Cold Shock Tomatoes. <PIC> Scoop your tomatoes out of the hot water with your slotted spoon, making sure to drain any excess, and drop them into the ice bath. \u00a0Leave them until cool, then set out on the counter stem-end down while you process the rest of your tomatoes.\nRemember to add more ice (and remove an equivalent volume of water to avoid spills) on a regular basis to keep the water bath nice and cold. Step 5: Peel!. <PIC> Now the peels should practically slide off of your tomatoes! \u00a0Sometimes a paring knife comes in handy for damaged areas, or tightly adherent skin around the stem, but it's still ridiculously easy.\nI prefer to peel over one bowl, then store the peeled tomatoes in a second bowl to avoid mess. \u00a0This way, you can squeeze out the accumulated tomato skins when you're done to make a nice glass of tomato water! \u00a0Just add a pinch of salt, and it's your treat for virtuously processing all those tomatoes.\nNow get started on your favorite tomato recipes!", "images_list": ["how-to-skin-tomatoes_0", "how-to-skin-tomatoes_2", "how-to-skin-tomatoes_3", "how-to-skin-tomatoes_4", "how-to-skin-tomatoes_5"]}

This dessert combines all three of them, turning figs and fire into pure deliciousness. We live in the San Francisco bay area, and so have access to an overabundance of figs when the neighborhood trees ripen. I'm always looking for more good ways to eat or preserve figs to ensure we make the most of this short season. Step 1: Tools and Ingredients. Figs: smear of butter 12-20 ripe figs (not too squishy - we'll be baking them) 1/3 cup sugar 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup Grand Marnier, Cointreau, or other orange liquor (or interesting liquor of your choice, 80proof or higher)Cream: 1 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon liquor (same type as above) 2 tablespoons sugarTools: 8 inch fry pan, oven and stove safe (or similarly-sized pan) electric mixer or beaters rubber spatula (optional but handy) Step 2: Bake Figs. <PIC>  Butter pan, stab the bottoms of the figs so they'll drop juices, and arrange figs so they're close but not touching. I could probably fit a few more figs in this pan, but we've already eaten the rest. Sprinkle over 1/3 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup water. Bake at 325F for about 30 minutes, basting every 10 minutes with pan juices. Poke your figs - if they're not cooked through, bake a little longer. The timing is pretty flexible. Step 3: Make Whipped Cream. <PIC>  Whip 1 cup heavy cream, 1 Tablespoon liqueur, and 2 Tablespoons sugar until cream is nice and thick, forming moderately-stiff peaks. Add a sprinkling of any spices you like - I'm fond of allspice with figs, but your mileage may vary. Chill until ready to serve. Step 4: Flame Figs. <PIC>  This is the good part! Pull your pan of figs out of the oven, add 1/4 cup of Cointreau, and place it on the stove at medium heat. Remember the pot handle is hot - I kept forgetting this, which caused a few problems. As soon as the liquid boils, remove from heat (important if you have a gas stove) and carefully prod at the air over the edge of the pot with a lit match. Note that you're not setting fire to the liquid: you're setting fire to the alcohol vapor just above the liquid, which will quickly catch the liquid itself on fire. Sit back and enjoy the show. If you can't get it to catch fire, add a bit more liquor (AWAY from any flame!) and reheat so the alcohol vapors are ready to go.\n         Step 5: Reduce Syrup. <PIC> After the fire dies down, remove figs from the pot and set them on a plate to cool. Place the pan back on the stove, and cook over medium-low until the liquid is syrupy. Stir as needed, and remove from heat when syrup is nicely syrupy. (Sorry, I'm not going to be able to explain it better than that. Just don't burn it.) Set aside to cool, as the syrup will be dangerously hot. Step 6: Serve. <PIC>  Scoop a blob of whipped cream onto a plate next to the figs. Drizzle the whole thing with the syrup, and garnish with some kind of fresh herb tips1 for maximally awesome presentation. All these ingredients store nicely! Just plop the figs into a bowl of syrup, and store the whipped cream separately. in fact, overnight marination will only make the figs taste better - it's just a matter of planning ahead.1Mint, thyme, etc. I only have rosemary growing right now, so skipped it.", "images_list": ["flaming-baked-figs_0", "flaming-baked-figs_2", "flaming-baked-figs_3", "flaming-baked-figs_4", "flaming-baked-figs_5", "flaming-baked-figs_6"]}

My family loves to snack.  None of us need empty calories and we can all use extra protein.  Enter into your diet Tofu Nuggets!  These things are so good that usually they don't make it off the cookie sheet.  When my 4-year-old requests for dinner Tofu Nuggets that should give you an idea of how good they are.  They are easy to make, but they do take some time.  They are worth it!  Let me show you how I do them. Step 1: Start With Tofu. <PIC> Ingredients:1 lb firm or extra firm tofu1 tbs oil (olive oil or vegetable oil works)1/4 tsp salt1/2 tsp curry powderTools:Stuff to press the tofu.BowlCookie sheetParchment paperOvenSpatulaStart by pressing your tofu.  I get tofu from a local Asian grocer (it's much cheaper there than anywhere else) and I put 1 lb in a paper towel, on a cloth hand towel, between two plates, and with some oil on top of the plate to press it for 30 minutes.  I start preheating the oven to 450\u00b0F when I have about 5 min left on the press.  When the 30 min are up I unwrap the tofu and cut it into about 1 cm^3 nuggets.   Step 2: Coat Your Tofu. <PIC> So while your oven is heating up to 450\u00b0F get your tofu ready.  I would suggest you put the parchment paper down on the cookie sheet first before this step so when you mix the tofu you do it over the cookie sheet so if anything falls out it goes on something clean.  So in a bowl put the cut up tofu, the oil, the salt, and the curry.  Gently mix with your hand (make sure your hand is clean first) until the tofu is evenly coated and then dump on the cookie sheet. Step 3: Bake/Eat. <PIC> When the oven is at 450\u00b0F and your tofu is ready put the tofu in the oven.  15 min use the spatula to turn the tofu, or at least mix it, and put it back in for another 15 min.  Total time in oven is about 30 min but this can vary depending on what consistency you want and also I've found the type of tofu.  The corners of the cubes should start to get very brown, but not burnt.  Take out the cookie sheet (use a hot-pad) and let it sit.The tofu comes out almost like chicken (you may not believe me but that is what it's like).  If you can stop yourself these make great salad toppings, or even little hors d'oeuvre with a cherry tomato and cucumber.  Typically these are just eaten as snacks.  I would like to say you can cover and store these in the refrigerator but they must be completely cool first.  These are good travel food, and excellent for when we go to an outdoor event.So total time just over an hour, but in that time you can get the salad and the rest of dinner ready.  Since these are good for the car they make great snacks to make the night before a trip.  I hope everyone likes them and I can't wait to hear what people to do try and spice them up.

Step 1: Make the Chocolate Clay. <PIC> Make sure you're using actual white chocolate chips, rather than the white candy chips. \u00a0If you're not sure, read the ingredients. \u00a0Real white chocolate has cocoa butter. \u00a0The crappy chips have hydrogenated vegetable oil (ick).\nMelt 3/4 C white chocolate chips with 2 1/2 T light corn syrup. \u00a0Stir until smooth, then let it cool. \u00a0Knead until smooth and pliable, adding a tiny bit of powdered sugar or cornstarch if it's too greasy. \u00a0Don't overuse the cornstarch or it'll taste powdery.\nIf you want to color some of the chocolate clay, separate those portions. Step 2: Prepare the Quilt Squares. <PIC> Add a little food coloring to each ball of chocolate clay. \u00a0You might want to first mix it in with a stick before kneading it so you don't get food coloring stains on your hands.\nChoose two or more colors and slice, roll, or assemble them in whatever way you want to make the pattern for the first type of \"fabric\" square. \u00a0Repeat until you've used all the colors.\nThe red and orange pattern was made by layering three flattened colors, rolling them up into a log, slicing the log, and arranging those roll slices along with leftover scraps to form a loose, swirly pattern. \u00a0Note the white corn starch in the red and orange squares; this is why I recommend you be VERY sparing with the cornstarch. \u00a0If it sticks to your fingers, it'll stick to the quilt and be less likely to fall apart, even if the quilt is stretched slightly over the stuffing.\nThe yellow piece was covered with tiny orange balls of clay and rolled flat to make dots.\nThe green and blue were made by placing thin strips of the various colors next to each other and rolling flat.\nThe purple squares are a looser swirl pattern than the red/orange.\nRoll the clay fabric flat. \u00a0Slice it into squares roughly the same size. Step 3: Assemble the Quilt Top. <PIC> Roll a piece of the uncolored white chocolate clay flat, and slice a rectangle; this will be roughly the size of your finished dessert. \u00a0Arrange colored squares on this white clay, leaving a border of white around the edges.\nI would recommend brushing a little bit of corn syrup on the white clay to help the colored squares adhere better. \u00a0Press them gently together in place.\nTake one edge of white chocolate and fold it up over the edge of the colored squares. \u00a0Press gently, then press \"stitches\" into the clay with a wooden skewer.\nPress the side of the skewer along the edges of the colored squares, making a gentle indentation to hold them down and squish them together. \u00a0\"Stitch\" the colored squares together by pressing little holes along the border with the wooden skewer.\nYou have now quilted chocolate. \u00a0Your chocolate quilt would be lovely on a frosted brownie, cupcake, or dill pickle (okay, maybe not the last one).\nI can't add notes to my photos, so:\nPhoto 1. Arrange squares, notice I used a little too much cornstarch on the red/orange squares\nPhoto 2. Fold the edge of the border over to barely overlap onto the colored squares\nPhoto 3. Stitching the edges down using a wooden skewer; notice the wavy edges on the sides. \u00a0You can even these up by pressing in with the side of the wooden skewer before stitching them\nPhoto 4. Pressing down on the borders of the colored squares, helping them stick and making the raised, \"quilted\" effect\nPhoto 5. Stitch the borders of the colored squares by poking little indentations with the point of the skewer after pressing all the edges down\u00a0 Step 4: Assemble Your Dessert. <PIC> In this case, I completed my quilted dessert with a semisweet chocolate clay bottom and almond nougat filling.\nStay tuned for an instructable with more details on almond nougat, or follow this recipe on Chow.com for peanut butter nougat, substituting almond butter for the peanut.\nI made the semisweet chocolate clay the same way I made the white, but I wasn't as careful about kneading until smooth because it was the bottom of the dessert. \u00a0I cut the rectangle slightly smaller than the top quilt, and cut a piece of almond nougat smaller than the bottom piece. \u00a0The quilt would've looked better and less puffy if I'd used less almond nougat, but... then it wouldn't have had as much almond nougat in it. \u00a0:)\nAfter placing the colored quilt on top of the nougat, I pressed down at the intersections of the squares with a wooden skewer in order to anchor it a bit more. \u00a0I added little cupcake decorations at the corners for fun, but it'd be just as good without sprinkles.\nI was going to make several more quilts, but my 3 year old discovered that the clay I was using was edible, and it didn't last long after that.\nThanks for reading! \u00a0I hope you try your own chocolate quilt.\nPhoto notes:\nPhoto 1. Finished dessert with lots of almond nougat (note how the excessive stuffing made the quilt bulge out and burst its \"seams.\" Cupcake pearls placed at corners of colored squares, chocolate clay as the base of the quilted dessert.\nPhoto 2. Semisweet chocolate chips and corn syrup in the unwashed bowl I'd used to make the white chocolate clay; yes, I'm messy like that.\nPhoto 3. Melted chocolate and corn syrup, not as smooth as it could be; if this was for the top of the dessert, I'd have heated it a little more to make sure it was all melted and stir a lot to make it smooth.\nPhoto 4. Rough, slightly sticky semisweet chocolate clay; this is good enough because it's for the bottom of the dessert and kids were starting to get into stuff by this point, so I had to hurry.\nPhoto 5. Lovely almond butter nougat with chopped almonds on top. \u00a0This would make a fabulous almond version of a knockoff Snickers bar. \u00a0I used the recipe from chow.com but added a little bit more salt and used smooth almond butter instead of crunchy peanut butter.\nPhoto 6. Overly generous layer of almond nougat on the chocolate clay base\nPhoto 7. Quilt top resting on the puffy filling; it bulged out enough that the colored squares loosened.\nPhoto 8.

You don't need to make a custom mold. There are many commercially available silicone molds, or you could just skip the mold completely, and cut them with cookie cutters, a knife, or even scissors.THIS PROJECT IS NOT ENDORSED BY LEGO. DON'T MAKE THE MOLD, OR THE CANDIES FOR SALE. - FOR PERSONAL DELICIOUS GEEKY BLISS ONLY\nFirst I'll tell you how to make the candy.\nI'll explain in detail how I made the mold in step 4. It really is very easy. UserGabebillings made the mold and documented the process in photos. See the first comment under step 4 to read his experience and see his photos.User ibeschierumade a \"making of\" video showing his kids creating Lego shaped gummy candies!\u00a0http://vimeo.com/36217289LEGO Gummies from Igor Beschieru on Vimeo.\nI bought the Food Grade Silicone from Douglas & Sturgess. They are a great San Francisco store that sells artists materials, mostly for sculpture and casting. They have some great info on their site.If you have kiddos that might mistake real bricks for the candy, you should consider whether it is safe to make these for them. Vegan option There is another kind of jelly candy called gellies or jellies. Those are made with Pectin. It's a different recipe entirely. I don't know how well they would mold though.\nHere is a Pectin Fruit Jelly Instructable. I haven't tested it in the mold but it seems like it should work. Pates de Fruit Step 1: Tools and Ingredients. <PIC> When I made the candies in the picture, I experimented with many, many different techniques and recipes to figure out how to get the best flavor, texture and clarity.\nI made them in small batches so I could do many experiments.\nThe recipe is for a small batch (one full mold for me). You will probably want to double, triple, or quadruple it.Recipe:\n1 package of flavored Gelatin (Jello)\n3 packets of Unflavored Gelatin (Knox is most common in the US - they come 4 packets to a box)\n1 500 mg Vitamin C (optional but it adds some great sour flavor)\n1/3 to 1/2 cup of waterTools:\nPyrex Measuring cup\nA cooking pot that the cup will fit into\nSome kind of spatula.\nMold or a flat bottom pan to pour the candy into\nMortar and Pestle (or a hammer?) to grind up the Vitamin C\nIn the photos you see me using a shallow pan with just about an 1\" - 1 1/2\" of water to melt the syrup. You should go ahead and use a pot with higher sides, so you can get the water level up another inch or two.\nI used the shallow pan so it would be easier to see what was happening in the photos. I use a sauce pan when I\u00a0make them now. A double boiler would be ideal, but I couldn't find one in the stores I visited. They aren't as popular as they used to be.\nThe syringe I used to fill the mold in the photos is optional. You can just pour the candy in. I bought the syringe at Tap Plastics. You can get big syringes like this in cooking stores also. There are syringes for injecting stuff into meats. They can handle the hot syrup really well but have a very small hole at the tip.\nI have a metal and plastic trigger activated frosting gun. It is used to decorate cakes. I don't remember when, or where I bought it. I tend to buy tools when they are on sale, and think up a use later. I decided to try it out with the gummy syrup and it worked great. That is what I use now.\n(The wire strainer in the photos is not needed. I reviewed my notes on the experiments and the clearest candies - the green and red, didn't use the strainer.) Step 2: Making the Candy. <PIC> To make gummies the only essential ingredient is unflavored gelatin.\nFor flavor I used flavored gelatin (Jello is one brand) plus a Vitamin C to bump up the pucker power.\nI expect they can be made by adding candy flavorings and sweetener to unflavored gelatin, but I haven't tried it.\nSee step 3 if you want to make Sour Gummies.\nThe amount of flavored gelatin you use is up to you. I'm recommending a full package of flavored gelatin for each batch. It gives the candy a pretty intense flavor.\nUse an extra packet of unflavored gelatin, and they will be even chewier. Use one less, and they will be softer.HERE WE GO:\n'You might look at all the writing below and think that this is way too much work. All you are going to be doing though, is mixing the powder in water, melting it and pouring it into molds. I've just written a ton, so you know a lot of the pitfalls and know exactly how I make them.'\nIf you don't really care how clear the candy is, just stir the powders in the water, put it in hot water on the stove and melt it, then pour it in the molds.\nIf you want them really clear then read the details below.\nI use a little over 1/3 cup of water (you can use even more for softer candies).\nMeasure 1/3 - 1/2 cup of cold water into your measuring cup.MIX IT UPSPRINKLE the gelatin powders into the water, as you continuously and gently stir it. Don't let the dry powder pile up. Sprinkle, stir, sprinkle, stir,... If you get a pile of gelatin and stir that in, it will make a lump, and lumps are hard to dissolve once you've made one. Do this rather quickly. The gelatin will immediately start absorbing the water. If you move too slowly it will get pretty dry towards the end and it will be very difficult to avoid lumps.\nIt will get very thick as you work in the powders. Sometimes it ended up like a lump of clay. Add just a tiny bit more water to the mix to get a slushy consistency. Either way will work fine. Scrape down the sides of your measuring cup and try to get all the gelatin down in contact with the wet stuff.LET IT REST\nCover the pyrex cup with plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes. The gelatin needs time to absorb the water before we heat it.\nYou can leave the spatula in the gelatin while it is resting, but don't leave any chunks of gelatin on the back of the spatula where it will dry.I'M MELTING...\nPut a pan of water on the stove and bring it up to a slow boil/fast simmer.\nIn the photos I'm using a shallow pan. I only did that so I could photograph the sides of the cup and let you see what was happening. I use a deeper sauce pan when I make them now.\nAfter the resting time, remove the plastic wrap and put the measuring cup in the water. The lump of clay or slushy material will melt but it does take several minutes. Occasionally stir it. Stir it gently. Don't get too vigorous and mix a lot of air in it, or you will have cloudy candy. (If you are adding vitamin C to sour them up, add it at the very end.)\nOnce it melts, you will see that it has a layer of foam on top. Try to avoid mixing that foam back into the melted syrup. When it is hot enough you will see there is a very thin layer of clear on the bottom, a layer that isn't as clear, then the layer of foam on top.\nNow stop stirring and just let it sit in the water for about 2 minutes. We are letting bubbles rise at this point.\n* For very clear candies: After melting the candy, put the pyrex cup in the fridge. Let it firm up. Then remove it from the cup and using a pair of scissors, cut it into chunks. Then using a knife or your scissors, carefully trim the foamy layer off. Remelt the clear chunks and you will end up with very clear syrup. Details of this process are in Step 5.FINALLY WE FILL THE MOLD\nNow I put my syringe into the bottom of the cup and suck up all that clear syrup.\nI use the syringe to squirt the candy into my mold.\n(Step 4 has other ways of molding the candy).\nIf your mold won't hold all the syrup you made, turn the heat off and let the cup sit in the water while your first batch of candy is setting up. When you pull the first batch out of the mold, just turn on the stove and melt the syrup that is still in the cup the same way we did it the first time.\nYou don't need to use any kind of release (no oil or cooking sprays) with gummies. They will peel off of anything that is smooth. If you get some on your stove, floor, or counter, don't bother to try to clean it up while it is wet and hot. It's much easier to just let it set up and peel it off.\nMost of the time when you make gummies you will not try to mold them in 360 degrees. The top side (which will be the bottom of the candies) is just left flat. I wanted to mold in little holes on the bottom of in my bricks so I could actually stack them.\nThe syrup contracts quite a lot as it cools. I had to fill the mold, then go back through and top them all off again as it would shrink way down. When I got them all full, I took the base plate (the same one I used when making the mold) and pressed it on the top of the mold, squeezing any extra goo out of the sides. Then I let it sit on the counter top for a couple of minutes. I do that, just so the stuff that leaked out the sides would set up and it wouldn't get all over my freezer when I put the mold in there.\nI put the mold with the lid (base plate) into the freezer. You only leave it in the freezer for 10 or 15 minutes. If you are going to leave it longer, or you think you might forget it, you can just stick it in the fridge. It will be fine there without any worries about leaving it too long.\nThese candies actually do not need to be refrigerated at all to set up. You can just leave your mold on the counter at room temperature and they will still set up. I use the freezer to get them done faster.\nOnce they are set up, take them out of the mold. Clean them up if they need it, and you are done. Step 3: Add Some Pucker Power - Sour Gummies. <PIC> Sour Gummies \nI really like sour flavors in gummy candies.\nThe official way to make sour gummies is to add Ascorbic Acid Powder. Other powders that will add sour are called Citric Acid or Vitamin C powder. You can buy it in a cooking store, a health food store that sells supplements, probably some pharmacies and I think it's even available at some bulk food stores.\nSometimes it is incredibly expensive, especially if it is from some \"Life Extension\" or \"Body Cleansing\" type of vitamin company.\nI've never bothered with buying the powder. Ascorbic acid is Vitamin C. I just grind up a Vitamin C tablet with my mortar and pestle. The cheaper the vitamin C the better the flavor I think. Rose hips Vitamin C is not as sour, and has some kind of non sour flavor. I'm not really sure how to describe it.\nI'm not sure what the chewables, or timed released Vitamin C's would do, or how they would taste. The added ingredients in those vitamins might not like being heated, and they might cloud up your candies. Just stick to plain cheap generic Vitamin C if you are going to grind your own. For pure sour pucker power, the cheaper the better.I add the powder of one 500mg Vitamin C to a batch of gummies. That will change the flavor so it doesn't taste so much like a Jello Flavor. I LOVE 3 Vitamin C's - that's a great candy flavor to me. It's one of those things you just have to do by taste. You might like more, or less, than I do.\nThe easiest way to sour up gummies, and to also give them more concentrated flavor is to add unsweetened Kool-Aid powder! There are a lot of flavor experiments you can try by mixing different flavored gelatin with different flavors of Kool-Aid. They don't come out very clear though.\nThere are all the other kind of powdered drink mixes. I don't know how they would react if you stirred them into the hot gummy syrup, but I'm sure they would be fine if you rolled the candies in them when you were finished. A good lemonade powder mix would probably taste pretty good.After it is melted and almost ready to go into the mold, stir in the Vitamin C, then let the syrup sit in the bath for a couple of minutes.\nThis info applies to candy making in general: When making candy, you will almost always add the flavorings right at the end. The reason is, sometimes flavorings can change flavor or breakdown completely when they are heated. When you are making candy, you will usually cook your candy first, then stir in flavorings right after you take it off the stove.\nHave fun and experiment. Step 4: Molds. <PIC> You don't need to make a custom mold like I did to make gummy candies. There are many great silicone molds available. They are used for making candies, baking, molding butter, making ice,...\nIt doesn't have to be made of silicone either. A regular Ice tray will work too. Any thing that has a flat and smooth surface should work fine. I read a suggestion, by a Mom on some recipe site, to pull the rack out of your toaster oven, put a piece of foil on it, and push the foil down through the slats. She made a gummy worm mold that way.\nThis stuff is very forgiving.Mold Options\nPour the candy in a flat pan and after it has gelled, then just slice it into squares, rectangles and triangles with a knife. You could cut shapes out with cookie cutters. You could even peel the sheet off in one piece, and cut it up with scissors.\nWhatever you do, I'd recommend you keep them pretty small. If you are using an ice tray, or a butter mold, or any mold with large compartments, don't fill it to the top. Just fill them up to around 1/4 or 1/2 an inch.\nYou can make Mega-Gummies if you really want to. Ever wanted a gummy the size of an Ice Cube? Go ahead. It will work fine. Want one shaped like a Banana? Go ahead - just don't tell me what you plan on doing with it.HOW I MADE THE SILICONE MOLD\nI purchased Food Grade Silicone fromDouglas & Sturgess. They are a Sculpture Tools, Materials and Supplies store in San Francisco. They are really great folks and have some incredible casting materials that you can't find anywhere else. I bet you MythBusters buys their Ballistics Gel there. Well, I guess I shouldn't bet. Where they bought it is probably on the web, and I've already spent enough money on this project.\nThe number I used is FGS-2237 Food Grade Silicone. (There is a new number MC-1287) Here is a link\nYou need two parts. Part A is the silicone gel and part B is the catalyst. They sell it as a set. This is a 1 lb. set.\nThe silicone must be weighed to make sure you put in the right amount of catalyst. It's 10 parts Silicone (part A) to 1 part Catalyst (part B). Buy yourself a gram scale to do this. You really want to be accurate. You don't want to waste this stuff because you measured wrong.\nI made my positive (the part that I made the mold from) out of - you guessed it - Legos!\nWhen I was a kid, way back in the last Century, Legos were still this strange toy from Scandinavia. That was where all the \"adult\" films and Anita Eckberg came from - she was our Paris Hilton. She was beautiful, classy, spoke with a sultry Swedish accent, and went to the best parties. Well I guess she wasn't very Paris Hiltonish at all.\nThe only kids who had Legos were the ones who had Moms, or Grandparents, from Europe, or a Dad that we never saw, because he was always \"away on business\". Those kids got cool gifts. You could tell some of them came from the Airport gift store though.\nI had an Erector set and was very happy with it.Woops Sorry I got sidetracked -HOW TO MAKE THE MOLD\nAs I was saying, I never had Legos and I still didn't have any when I decided to make this project. I visited the Lego website and found a set that I really wanted that had enough pieces for my mold and bought that. I planned what I needed with the Lego Digital Designer. It's a free software program you can download from Lego and it lets you build Lego stuff in VR. It will even count up the pieces for you and place an order.\nI wanted my tray to not waste any space. If I left more than a single peg between each candy piece I'd be wasting the silicone.\nWhen I got the Legos - I built the Taj Mahal - I couldn't resist! Have you seen it? It's amazing. 5,922 pieces.\nSo three days later, after I finished the Taj, I started taking it apart to get my candy mold pieces.\nI put the pieces on a tray, and ringed the tray edge with a double stack of pieces to act as a wall and hold the silicone in (there is a photo of it below). Legos are made so well, that they really fit tightly together. I found that I didn't have to seal any of the cracks between the pieces inside.\nSilicone will not stick to Legos. So you don't need to put any kind of mold release on the positive.\nJust stick the pieces in there and make sure you stick them down really good.Weigh the Silicone\nTo measure how much silicone you are going to need to fill the mold, you can measure it a couple of ways. The standard way is to fill the positive with water, pour the water into the plastic cup you are going to mix it in, and just draw a line on the cup at the water line. That is how much silicone you will need to fill the mold.\nYou can't let any water get anywhere near your silicone before you cast it though. If you measure your mold with water, make sure you allow plenty of time for it to get bone dry before you try to make your mold.\nTo avoid the water problem I used Lentils - yeah like in the soup - but dry ones. They have some really small black ones at the bulk food store and they don't put out any dust, so they are great for this. Just pour the lentils over your positive, then pour them into your mixing container. They don't mess your positive up at all. Then you don't have to worry about liquid spoiling your mold.\nPut your plastic container - with the line marked on it, on your gram scale and set the scale to zero. That way you won't be weighing your plastic cup, just the silicone. Now pour enough of Part A to get up to your marked line. Don't just glop it in there, try to avoid causing any air pockets. Check to see how much the silicone weighs. Let's say it measured 350g. Because you use 10 parts A and 1 part B, you will need 10% of that weight in Catalyst or 35g. Zero (sometimes the button you use to do this is labeled \"Tare\") your scale out, with the silicone still on it. Then add the 35g of Part B right into the same container.Mix it up\nMix your Part A and your Part B with something plastic. The catalyst is blue and the silicone is white so you can tell if you have it mixed. Scrape the sides and bottom as you do it. You want to be careful not to mix any extra air into it. Does that sound familiar? Just like the Gummies!\nIf you really want to make a perfect mold then you have to \"de-air\" the silicone. As this involves putting it in a vacuum chamber and most of us don't have one, you can just skip that step. There are lots of tips on the web on how to get the least bubbly silicone castings.Pour it in your tray\nYou will pour the mixed silicone over the positive. Fill the tray up until you cover the tops of the pieces.\nPour slowly and don't move the Silicone back and forth like you are drizzling on frosting. That will leave air bubbles in the corners around your pieces. Pour it in a stream that hits the bottom of the tray - not over the Lego pieces, and let it flow around the tray and fill it up. This will help you avoid trapping any air.\nSilicone is pretty good about releasing bubbles so you probably will get a pretty good mold.\nI'd tap the tray a few times, and I've even held a back massager against it to help it release any air. You need to be very careful, that any of this tapping, or vibrating doesn't loosen any of the pieces inside the mold. I did a test piece and when I was tapping it, one of them floated to the top! I just grabbed my plastic spoon and pushed it back down. The only problem it caused was I wasted silicone, because the inside filled up. Avoid that by making sure your pieces are stuck down really well before you pour in the Silicone.Let it set up\nDon't try to clean up the cup and tools right now. Let them sit overnight. Most of it will set up and you can just peel it off. If you find you have any sticky spots of silicone gel, you can clean those off by dabbing them with a little Catalyst. That will make them set up and you should be able to peel it off.\nLet the silicone set at least overnight, then just pull the Legos out of it. They will come out very easily. Let it set up for 24 hours before you use it. I put mine in the oven at 175 degrees for about 15 minutes after it had already been curing for 24 hours, just to make sure. It might not have been the right thing to do (I should have asked Douglas and Sturgess) but I knew they did that with some of the other silicones.\nAfter you get the Legos out, just trim off any of the little bits that squeezed between the pieces. Wash the mold and you are ready to go.\nNow if you will excuse me, I have to go rebuild the Taj Mahal. Step 5: Addendum: How to Get Really Clear Candies. <PIC> ADDENDUM: How to get very clear candies\nI figured out how to get really clear candies with almost no bubbles.\nI\u00a0started by straining my vitamin C through a paper coffee filter so I got most of the solids out. I\u00a0ended up with a very sour liquid that looked like water.\nThe secret to clear candies is to melt it twice.\nAfter the first cycle of heating, let it rest, and cool off in the refrigerator. Almost all of the bubbles will rise to the surface while it is cooling. When it is cool enough to handle, take it out of the cup (the foam layer sticks to the cup, just cut through it around the edge of the cup with a knife). Put some water in the cup to get that foam to soften up so you can clean it out before you heat the candy again.\u00a0\nNow take your lump of clear candy with the foam layer and cut the foam layer off. I\u00a0found a clean pair of kitchen scissors works well. I call them \"kitchen scissors\" because I only use them with food and they stay in the kitchen. You can use any kind of scissors. I cut the big piece into chunks, then I trim the foam layer off.\nI've also done this with a knife but you have to be really careful. I\u00a0don't worry about getting it perfect. The bit of clear that remains on the foam can be melted down at the end to make some candies for the cook to eat after the main batch. When you melt the foamy chunks, you will probably find the clear part melts into a very clear layer. You can siphon that out with your syringe if you want. I just pour it in to about spoon sized circles on a silicone baking mat. Then I peel those dots up when they solidify and put them in a baggy for me to eat. They taste just as good.\nMelt all of those clear chunks. No real need to stir it while it is melting. I leave it alone so I don't add any bubbles. I just give it a gentle stir at the end before I\u00a0suck it up into the syringe.\nThis technique makes amazingly clear candies. I have two pyrex cups so I make a second batch while the first one is cooling, then while No. 2 cools, I cut the foam layer off No.1 and melt it for casting.", "images_list": ["legummies-brick-shaped-gummy-candies_0", "legummies-brick-shaped-gummy-candies_1", "legummies-brick-shaped-gummy-candies_2", "legummies-brick-shaped-gummy-candies_3", "legummies-brick-shaped-gummy-candies_4", "legummies-brick-shaped-gummy-candies_5"]}

Mix your meat with your salt, pepper, and 3-4 tablespoons of barbeque sauce (or spicy mustard).2. Using about a golf ball sized amount of meat, form a small bowl about an inch deep and 2 inches wide. Make sure all the sides are firm and solid. If your meat is weak around the corners, the insides will melt out and fall apart during the cooking  process.3. Fold your cheese slice into quarters and place them inside your meat so their height is even with the bowl.4. Fill the center with garlic and onions until they are even with the height of the bowl as well.5. Set the roll on your bacon strip so you have enough lip to wrap the bacon to the top of each side of the roll.Now fold the long end of your bacon strip sideways and wrap it tightly  around your meat roll. Make sure it is nice and tight, keeping you  burger meat solid. once again, If your do not, the bacon might unroll  during cooking and weaken your burger until the insides melt out and  fall apart. Step 5: . <PIC> 1. When placing your roll on grill, do not place it directly over coals.  Due to the filling, you will not be able to flip your rolls while  cooking. Set rolls along the outside of your coals and Barbeque slowly  until your hamburger meat and bacon are fully cooked. 2. When rolls are about done, brush on some barbeque sauce or spicy mustard (your choice).  Let it cook for a few more minutes to let the sauce caramelize a little. 3.

They are so convenient. Especially for me where the weather is colder more than it is warm which makes proofing dough almost impossible.Phoenix is the place for great pizza. Seriously Pizzaria Bianco has been said to be the best pizza in the USA. It's real good and Chris Bianco makes perfect pizza dough/crust. Here is his recipe courtesy Martha Stewart:Chris Bianco's Pizza Dough - enough for 4 this 12 inch pizzas\n    * 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (one 1/4-ounce envelope)\n    * 2 cups warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)\n    * 5 to 5 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, preferably organic\n    * 2 teaspoons fine sea salt\n    * Extra-virgin olive oil, for bowl1. Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cups flour and the salt, stirring until smooth. Stir in an additional 2 cups flour; continue adding flour (up to 1/2 cup), 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring until dough comes away from bowl but is still sticky.2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and knead with lightly floured hands. Start by slapping the dough onto the counter, pulling it toward you with one hand and pushing it away from you with the other. Fold the dough back over itself (use a bench scraper or a wide knife to help scrape dough from surface). Repeat until it's easier to handle, about 10 times. Finish kneading normally until dough is smooth, elastic, and soft, but a little tacky, about 10 minutes.3. Shape dough into a ball and transfer to a lightly oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover with plastic, and let rise in a warm place until it doubles in volume, 3 hours. Press it with your finger to see if it's done; an indent should remain.**I like to punch the dough down after it has doubled and let it rise again but it isn't completely necessary. Step 2: Mac N' Cheese. <PIC> Before making the mac n' cheese place a pizza stone in oven and preheat to 500 degrees F. You will want the stone in the oven about one hour before making any pizza on it.Woldini's Famous Mac n' Cheese\n1 1/2 T. Butter\n1 1/2 T. Flour\n1/2 T. Ground Mustard\n1/2 t. Onion Powder\n1/2 t. Black Pepper\n1 c. Whole Milk\n8 oz. Sharp Cheddar Cheese\n6 oz. pasta - cooked according to package directions\nIn a medium sauce pan over medium-high heat melt butter. Add flour and ground mustard and whisk. Cook approximately 3-5 minutes to cook off the flour taste. Mixture will be come thick and smooth.\nAdd in onion powder, pepper and whole milk. Whisk until mixture become thick and can coat the sides of the pan when tilted.\nAdd cheese and whisk until smooth.\nAdd pasta to cheese and gently stir to coat all pasta. Set aside. Step 3: Make Pizza. <PIC> Lightly flour a work surface or cutting board.\nCut 1/4 piece of the dough. Shape into a ball and coat lightly in flour.\nUsing fingertips press out the dough into a round circle about 6 inches in diameter.\nPinch the edges of the dough to create a border. This will help keep the dough from tearing later while tossing it.\nGently pick up the dough and using the backs of your hands and fingers rotate while gently pulling the dough larger. Try to keep the thickness as even as you can although it will most likely be impossible! It doesn't matter, it just makes it all the more rustic and homemade.\nOnce the dough stretches to about 12 inches in diameter put it down on a pizza peel generously sprinkled with organic coarse cornmeal. You can use regular cornmeal if you don't have coarse but only use flour as a last resort. It's hard to work with.

{"id": "RECIPE_457", "question": "What is the best way to preserve and enjoy leftover turkey from the holidays?", "provenance": [40298], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Super Easy Trick for Saving Leftover Turkey. <PIC> Okay, so the holidays are over and you find yourself confronted with the classic dilemma of glorious holiday excess: too much turkey. And maybe there's some ham, maybe you made a few more brussels than last year, and maybe Great Aunt Thelma's just not hitting the potatoes since she got on that new diet. Either way, you have a problem.\nSure you could spin off your turkey left overs into an ever shifting array of sandwiches, soups, and casseroles. For many people this is a cherished part of the holidays. For me, it guarantees I wont crave turkey again til Easter roles around.\nYour holiday meal was a work of art, a perfectly balanced mix of meat, vegetables, and starches. Why do it a disservice by turning it into something else? If only there was some way to freeze a balanced meal exactly as it was without that pesky freezerburn.... Step 1: Step 1: Gravy, Your Magic Turkey Preservative. <PIC> Whether it's white or brown, thick or thin, vegan or distilled from an extract of pure Animalia, there is one thing all gravy has in common:It is awesome\nNot only is gravy awesome tasting, but it has an awesome ability to prevent freezer burn in frozen foods. Freezer burn is a common name for the process of sublimation, in which a solid transitions directly into a gas without making a social appearance in liquid form in between. In the case of your turkey dinner, this means the water is drawing straight out of the exposed surfaces of your food to be vented off or recrystallized elsewhere, leaving your food vulnerable to oxidation. This will cause profound denaturation of every delicious protein that gives your late, beloved gobbler its texture and flavor properties. It's also no picnic for potatoes, stuffing, and green bean casserole.\nTo remedy, prepare your three course meal exactly as desired in a single freezer bag and pour in your desired accompaniment of gravy. By coating your entire meal before freezing, you have created a moisture barrier to halt or delay the sublimation of water from your food. It's okay, the gravy forgives you. Step 2: Step 2: a Consideration. <PIC> You might be noticing only the bottom part of your bag is gravied. This presents a problem, any exposed food will freezer burn. You could just pour in the rest of your gravy and brew some more up on the stove.\nBut.... we are steeped thickly in the modern age of lifestyle illnesses. A liter of gravy might not be the best choice for everyone. So how do you ensure a thin, even glass of gravy freezes over your entire sack of delicious? Step 3: Step 3: Suction Is Key. <PIC> Suction! Air is the enemy, air is what will carry away our precious moisture and ruin that delicious turkey meal. Simply cinch all but one corner of the freezer bag, suck the air out, label, date, and pop it in the freezer. If you don't expect to share your precious cache of bird meat, just do it by mouth.\nThe cold, dry conditions all but ensure anything harmful you carry will be dead before it can spread. Furthermore, as you are popping it right in the freezer and cooking on removal, the risk of bacterial toxins and endospores is all but negligible. It wont be restaurant grade, I wouldn't do it in a lab, and it will not escape the taint of cooties, but really it will be as safe as anything else you eat. Stop sucking in air as soon as the gravy starts to rise up the bag and above the food.\nNow you can have a delicious turkey dinner well after your New Year's resolutions fall by the wayside, enjoy! Step 4: Afterthoughts. This has been a tradition in my family for a few years now when I come back and visit for the holidays. I love it as I get a great family dinner full of warmth and love any time I like and hours away. While at first we tried freezing the dinners and packing them tight for the long drive home, the food was frequently partly defrosted by the time I got home. As a food safety buff, it was less than ideal, beyond the flavor effects of refreezing.\nA super cheap and easy solution is to make an insulating sack out of recycle bin newspapers and an old shopping bag or two. Pack in the meals, put about a pound of dry ice on top, and seal it tight. On a 7 hour drive, one block of dry ice can freeze 5 cold meals solid with some snow left to spare. Your mileage may vary so be careful! Dry ice can be dangerous when mishandled, and food safety is a matter too broad to be covered here and in no means to be taken lightly.\nHappy holidays from Punk Love Designs!", "images_list": ["super-easy-trick-for-saving-leftover-turkey_0", "super-easy-trick-for-saving-leftover-turkey_1", "super-easy-trick-for-saving-leftover-turkey_2", "super-easy-trick-for-saving-leftover-turkey_3"]}

I\u00a0figured\u00a0it would be a good time to start praticing making Nerds and maybe you would enjoy it too. Otherwise,\u00a0they\u00a0would cute Halloween decorations that actually taste good.\nThings You Will Need:\nChocolate (Atleast 12 Ounces,bI used actual white chocolate but have read that almond bark or colored candy disk\u00a0are better)\nCorn Syrup\nNerds\nMicrowaveable Bowl(s)\nMicrowave\nBowl Scraper\nSmall Bowls or Lids\nPlastic Bags\nWax Paper (I used a Plastic Bag Instead) Step 1: Get Your Chocolate Ready. <PIC> \n\tRecipe:\n\t12 Ounces of Chocolate\n\t1/4 cup of Corn Syrup\n\tFirst, the chocolate needs to be melted.

Yes especially this year, the climate is really horrible. Hot sunny in the morning whereas in the night its pretty chill & cold. But today in the evening, despite of hot sun, suddenly started pouring heavy rain. I being chat lover, (Infact craving for chat items from last sunday since we had yummy delicious dinner in Sankaranthi Restaurant) was very tempted to eat something spicy& tangy. Added to that my MIL send me some green mangoes from her garden.I am bit tempted and thinking what recipe I can prepare in Jiffy.I called my friend and she suggested this quick chat recipe. Yes its the famous \" Kaara pori\". I felt very refreshed as we shared some old memories of beach chatting with our school friends. Hmm.. Its very common in Indian beaches selling Kaara pori aka Masala pori, whereas here am totally missing this pori & my friends. With all nice memories wholeheartedly, I prepared this recipe. I dedicate to all my friends who get remind of their beach chatting. Lets go for this quick recipe. Step 1: Information About the Ingredients Needed :. <PIC> Puffed rice :Puffed rice is a type of puffed grain made from rice; usually made by heating rice kernels under high pressure in the presence of steam, though the method of manufacture varies widely.Puffed rice is used in breakfast cereals, snack foods like puffed rice cakes, and is also a popular street food in some parts of the world. It is an ingredient of bhel puri, a popular Indian chaat (snack). It is also used in temples and gurdwaras as prasad (an offering).Pori is offered to Hindu gods and goddesses in all poojas in the South Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Pilgrims of Sabarimala often pack puffed rice in their Irumudikettu along with jaggery meant to be offered to Lord Ayyappan. Tamil saints say that Lord Ganesh loves pori, so it should be offered to him without fail. Pori (Puffed Rice) has been mentioned in various Tamil literatures as an offering to Hindu deities. Offerings of pori and jaggery made to Vinayagar (Lord Ganesh) are mentioned in the Tiruppugazh, a 15th-century anthology of Tamil religious songs, written by Tamil poet Arunagirinathar.\nPori production has been the main family business for centuries among many villages around Namakkal, Avinashi in Tamil Nadu.\nIn Telangana, as a snack typically given to children, puffed rice or bongulu is made into ball with jaggery syrup or bellam pakam.\n\nJhal Mudhi (Puffed rice) of Baripada\n\n\nMudhi is a staple food of people of Odisha.[1] northern Odisha, especially Baripada, Mayurbhanj district is significant for the production of Mudhi, where throughout the state it is eaten in breakfast.[2] NGOs have taken forward initiatives to engage village women of northern Odisha for producing Mudhi.[3]Intellectual property rights (IPR) Cell of Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) has decided to bring out Geographical indication (GI)registration of Mudhi.[4]\nA traditional puffed rice called muri (sometimes spelled mouri) is made by heating rice in a sand-filled oven. Muri is to rice as popcorn is to corn. The processing involved makes rice less perishable. Mandakki is a staple food in many parts of Rayalaseema, North Karnataka, Odisha, West Bengal andBangladesh. Jhalmuri or Masalemandakki is a very popular preparation made from mandakki (muri).[5]\nPuffed rice is referred to as mur-mure in some parts of India. In many parts of Rayalaseema, North Karnataka uggani along with Menasinakaayi Bajji (Chilli Bajjis) are popular. In Karnataka, Mandakki Usli made from mandakki is also famous. In Mithila area, \"murhi\" is had with \"kachari\"-fried potato/onion chops, fried fish or with mutton curry. \"Jhal-murhi\" and \"Murhi-Bhuja\" are also very popular snacks in this area. In Madhya Pradesh, this is referred to as Parmal and its very often eaten with Sev as a snack and also used in Bhel. (Source : Wikepedia).Chat Masala :This spice powder is a combination of corriander seeds powder, cumin powder, cloves, cinnamon & black pepper powder. My mom used to prepare this powder and keep it at fridge.So whenever we want we can use. But here I used ready made mix. I showed the picture that I used. Step 2: Ingredients :. <PIC> Puffed rice (Pori) - 1 cupPeanuts - 1/4 cup\nOnion- 1/2 cup (Finely chopped)\nTomato - 1 (Finely chopped)\nGarlic - 2 cloves (Crushed)\nCarrot - 1/4 cup (Finely chopped)\nMore milagai (Buttermilk chilli) - 1\nGreen mango- 1/4 cup (Finely chopped)\nLemon - 1\nRed chilli powder - 1/4tsp\nTurmeric powder - 1/4 tsp\nChat Masala - 1/4 tsp\nCurry leaves - 1 spring\nOil - 1 tbsp\nsalt to tasteI enclosed the picture of puffed rice for reference. For more information about puffed rice please check the following link :http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffed_rice Step 3: Method :. <PIC> In a pan, add oil followed by adding peanuts. Fry till it become crispy.(Be careful not to burn it). Keep it aside. In the same pan, add crushed garlic & curry leaves. Saute it for 2 mins. Now add more milagai, turmeric powder & red chilli powder and mix it well. Keep this masala aside.\n\nIn the mean time, get ready with onions, mango, carrot & tomato. Chop them finely. In a wide bowl, mix chopped onion, mango, carrot & tomato. Add the fried masala (Mentioned above) and roasted peanuts. Mix it well. Now add puffed rice or pori and mix it gently. Add chat masala and desired salt. Finally squeeze lemon to the mixture and serve.  The amount of lemon should balance the chilli and chat masala taste. Check for salt, spicy and tangy. The perfect flavour of crushed garlic together with richness of masalas will take you to beach virtually. Enjoy spicy masala pori. \n\n\nNote : Squeeze lemon only before serving. Else pori becomes gooey.

{"id": "RECIPE_490", "question": "What is the best way to create a delicious frappuccino without using a blender?", "provenance": [40320], "ground_truth": "Introduction: How to Make a Frappuccino Without a Blender. <PIC> The other day I was trying to think of how I could make a frappuccino at work without a blender. I was thinking about my options and remember the Slush Mug. I've never had one before, but always wanted to try one. So, I decided to go for it and buy one to see if it would work and it did!Now, this won't magically make you a frozen frappuccino. It takes time for it to work (roughly 23 minutes to get the desired consistency), but you get great results. It's especially good because you are guaranteed to not have big chunks of ice in your drink. I think it works out pretty good especially since I want to use it at work so I won't just be there drinking it. So it can freeze while I'm sitting there working.*This cup actually contains 2 slush mugs worth of drink. Step 1: Supplies. <PIC> You are going to need your slush cup and the ingredients for your drink for this project. One option is to go with this Vanilla Frappuccino recipe.Below I'm going to give the basics of making up your own Frappuccino with whatever syrup flavors you want. All you really need is the proportions then you can try out different syrup combinations. Also, the slushie cup is only going to hold about a cup or so of liquid. So you can scale down for one serving, or make multiple servings ahead of time and use it as you need it (this is a good method as the mix will always be nice and cold and ready to go in the slush mug).Drink Ingredients:6c Milk - My slush mug suggests you use Skim Milk, but I've had success with 2%. I would stay away from whole or anything thicker.1/2c - 1c Strong Coffee (I only used 1 cup because I'm not a huge fan of coffee flavor, but if you like it, go ahead and add more in)24 tbsp of Syrups + Simple Syrup (I'm going to keep this in tablespoons so that you can easily do different combinations) | I did 12tbsp Caramel Syrup and 12tbsp simple syrup - use less or more if you prefer, I like things sweeter.Rough Estimate of Single Serving:3/4c of Milk + Strong coffee (I would say to just put them together in a measuring cup to get an idea of how much of each)2tbsp Caramel Syrup (or syrup of choice)1-2tbsp Simple SyrupSupplies:Freezer (duh) Slush Mug* Reusable StrawsSpoon for stirring* This is what I used, but there are other products you can consider. I looked around before I decided what product to buy. Step 2: Preparation. <PIC> To get started, you need to freeze your slush mug core. The product directions suggest you let it freeze for 6-12 hours in the coldest part of the freezer. I don't know what part is technically the coldest, but it would be best to keep it as far from the door as you can.Mix up your drink. It is good to do this ahead of time as you can then have enough for multiple drinks and they suggest you have the drink cold when you put it in the mug. By having it premixed there is no delay with mixing; you just take it out of the fridge and pour it in the mug.Drink Ingredients:6c Milk - My slush mug suggests you use Skim Milk, but I've had success with 2%. I would stay away from whole or anything thicker.1/2c - 1c Strong Coffee (I only used 1 cup because I'm not a huge fan of coffee flavor, but if you like it, go ahead and add more in)24 tbsp of Syrups + Simple Syrups (I'm going to keep this in tablespoons so that you can easily do different combinations) | I did 12tbsp (3/4c) Caramel Syrup and 12tbsp (3/4c) simple syrup - use less or more if you prefer, I like things sweeter. Step 3: Use Your Slush Mug. <PIC> You should stir the drink every few minutes or so. I think it's mostly important that you scrape down any frozen drink that is sticking to the inside of the cup. You want to make sure it is all staying mixed and slushie.Keep bringing the frozen mixture from the bottom of the glass to the top and let the liquid go down to the bottom as much as you can as it appears to freeze more from the bottom up.2:00 - Still all liquid5:30 - Some frozen to scrape from the side of the cup8:00 - Same13-14:00 - Started to be more slushie18:00 - Little more slushie23:00 - More slush27:00 - More slush30:00 - About as slushie as it is going to get. Pretty much all slush at this point. Step 4: Enjoy. <PIC> You can choose to drink it out of the Slush Mug or in another cup. The product suggests you take it out so you can refreeze the core right away so it will be ready for next time. I noticed that when I drank it right from the mug, it continued to keep refreezing it, so it actually never melted (or at least never melted by the time I finished it). So to play it safe, just leave it right in the mug. If you wanna be fancy, put it in another cup. Also, if you leave it in the slush mug, you'll probably have to scrap the sides from time to time since it will keep freezing. I just used my straw.", "images_list": ["how-to-make-a-frappuccino-without-a-blender_0", "how-to-make-a-frappuccino-without-a-blender_1", "how-to-make-a-frappuccino-without-a-blender_2", "how-to-make-a-frappuccino-without-a-blender_3", "how-to-make-a-frappuccino-without-a-blender_4"]}

Usually, when that happens, I'll go with shredded beef or chicken, or even spicy tilapia. When I saw pork belly on sale at the local supermarket, however, I knew I wanted to try something different. Hopefully, this recipe will inspire you to try something new as well.As always, thanks for reading. Step 1: INGREDIENTS. <PIC> Pork belly is a very decadent cut of meat. It is generally used to make American style bacon. Most of the recipes I found on the internet using pork belly were of the \"how to make bacon\" variety.You will need:2 lbs pork belly. (Depending on where you get it will determine the size. I got mine from the grocery butcher.)1/2 Cup brown sugar2 tsp. chili powder1/2 tsp garlic powder1/2 tsp onion powder1/2 tsp cumin1/4 tsp ground all-spice1.5 tsp sea salt-For this recipe, I procured a 4 lbs belly. However, since I didn't want to use it all for this recipe, I set aside half of it to make bacon.- Step 2: PREP. <PIC> Combine your spices in a bowl and set aside. As my belly came with skin, I chose to leave it on and make a series of diamond slashes in it to allow the spices to soak in. I placed the meat on a wire rack in a roasting pan and rubbed the spices on heavily. -I placed the remaining spice rub in a bag to use for my bacon-I placed the pan in the fridge for an hour, then heated my oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Step 3: BAKE. <PIC> I placed the pan in the oven initially for 10 minutes. This allowed the spice mix to melt a little and let the fat and skin on the top crisp slightly. I removed it from the oven and reduced the heat to 220 degrees Fahrenheit.When the oven had cooled slightly, I added 1.5 Cups of water to the bottom of the pan and placed it back in the oven for 90 minutes.After 90 minutes, the internal temperature reached 160 degrees Fahrenheit. I wanted the temperature to hover around this point for as long as possible for collagen in the connective tissues to break down, so I lowered the oven to 195 degrees Fahrenheit and placed the belly back in the oven for another 90 minutes. I also added another 1.5 cups of water to the pan.Now it was time to render the fat a bit. I raised the temperature up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and removed the rack. I wanted it to braise in it's liquid. After 30 minutes, I flipped the belly skin down and added 2 cups of water and 1 cup of cider vinegar. After that, back into the oven for another 60 minutes. Step 4: REST and SHRED. <PIC> I removed it from the oven and allow it to rest for 20 minutes. I cut off the skin and the fat cap then I shredded that sucker. I ended up with 3/4 lbs of tender, succulent shredded pork belly. Instead of wasting the skin and fat cap, I decided to make chicharones (also known as lardons) I simply fried the skin pieces in fat until they started popping like pig popcorn. These can be either eaten like they are or added to beans/soups to add flavor. Step 5: SERVE IT UP. <PIC> I heated up some corn tortillas in an iron skillet and loaded them down with the shredded pork belly, shredded cabbage and lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. With a dash of fresh lime they were delicious! I made another couple of tacos with the shredded cabbage and lettuce, Sriracha, and shredded cheese as well. They were so good I didn't even get to take pictures before they were eaten.I think the pork belly was a success. If you decide to try this for yourself, please tell me how it turned out.

A while back I bought mini tart shells imagining I would be using them weekly. Well, It's been almost a year since I bought them, still unused. I decided today was the day I created something tasty with these pans!  Step 1: The Dough. <PIC>    For the dough I mixed 1/2 cup of margarine with 1/4 cup of sugar until just mixed. I then added 1 1/2 cups of flour that had a pinch of salt, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, a pinch of ginger and a pinch of nutmeg already sifted in. Mix your dough until just combined and no more. Wrap up your dough and put it in the fridge for about 40 minutes. Step 2: Rolling the Dough. <PIC>    Roll your dough out to about 1/4 inch and lay it in your tart shell pans. I used a fork to poke holes in the dough so when it baked the air bubbles could escape and leave the finished product without air bubbles. I baked these in a 400 degree oven until they were almost golden brown (8-10 minutes but keep and eye on them because my oven is kinda wonky).    Pull your shells out and brush them with a thin coat of beaten egg, this will keep your shells nice and crisp once all of the wet filling is added. Put them back in the oven until everything is a light golden brown. Pull your shells out and leave them to cool. Step 3: The Filling. <PIC> I cut up 3 Macintosh apples (use your favorite) roughly and put them in a pot with the juice and zest of half a lemon, 2 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of margarine, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of both ginger and nutmeg.   I cooked this on medium heat until the apples were nice and soft. Leave this mixture to cool slightly.  Step 4: Apples on Top. <PIC>    I took another 3 macs, cored them and sliced them up. These will be put on top to make our tart pretty. I left them soaking in water with lemon juice to help keep them from discoloring.  If you were working with a firmer apple you could cook these down a bit but at the end we will be broiling these apples and I found mine softened to a good consistency like that. Step 5: Filling Your Tarts. <PIC>    With all of my elements slightly cooled I even divided my apple filling between all 7 tart shells.

Better and cheaper than the jars you can buy. Step 3: Freezing Leafy Herbs. <PIC> Use a food processor to chop the herbs, removing large stalks.

{"id": "RECIPE_540", "question": "What\u2019s the overall process for crafting a severed arm cake that\u2019s both spooky and delicious?", "provenance": [40350], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Severed Arm Cake. For a interestingly bothersome yet kinda cool Halloween cake, I decided to create a severed arm. Yup...that's right. It's gorey, slightly realistic, a little bothersome and gross but it's all cake after all - and hey, that's Halloween for ya. This is indeed quite simpler than it looks, especially if you have a good hand with rolled cakes (pumpkin roll, etc.)You'll Need:Jelly roll pan (or 9x14 pan)Cake batter (1/2 the amount)Maroon or red colored frostingStrawberry cake fillingMaroon or red food colorwaterBlack fondantSkin tone (any shade) fondantBrown petal dustYellow petal dustParchment paperSpatula or knife Step 1: Jelly Roll. <PIC> We're going to start off by making a rolled cake for the arm.To do this, grease a jelly roll pan and line with parchment paper. Pour enough batter to come up about an 1 inch (enough for 1 9 in. pan). Bake for about 15 minutes at 350 degrees. When baked, remove from the pan while warm. With the parchment attached to the bottom, lay another piece of parchment on top. Roll the cake up and allow to cool. Once the cake is cooled, carefully unroll it and remove the top layer of parchment. Smear with red frosting and roll back up, using the bottom parchment to help roll the cake up while peeling it away at the same time. Measure the cake with your own arm to decide where the elbow would be. Cut that piece, bend it and cover the cake with frosting, smooth and refrigerate until cold.  Step 2: Hand. <PIC> For this you'll need to make a cake dough and a tracing of your own hand. Make a cake dough by adding a bit of frosting to cake crumbs and combine until the dough can be easily molded (similar to clay). Place a piece of parchment onto the stencil and shape the cake dough to the hand stencil. Watch the video tutorial to get a full grasp of this step. Allow the cake to chill until hardened. Carefully remove the hand from the parchment and attach to the arm. Use cake dough to shape the arm into the hand, then cut a small gap away from the wrist.  Step 3: Cover. <PIC> Roll out the fondant and cover the arm and hand separately making sure to keep that gap open. Carefully shape the fondant around the fingers. This is easiest when using a fondant ball tool to get in between fingers. Then cut away the fondant and tuck any extra under the arm. Cut knuckles into the fingers. I then used brown petal dust to add shadow and bring out muscular features to the arm. This step is crucial to make a realistic arm. Bring the dust between the fingers, around the knuckles and down the arm. Remember to blend out the dust so that there are no harsh lines.Make the fingernails by indenting with a small tool. I used the back end of a paint brush. Then dust the edge with brown petal dust. This is when you'd make any small or large cuts into the arm and fingers. Step 4: Getting Gorey. <PIC> Add a small amount of water or clear extract to yellow petal dust (you can substitute with yellow gel dye) and color the wrist and all large and small cuts that you've created.  Paint the cuts red with burgundy or maroon gel dye. I then made a huge gash where the arm bends and painted that gash as well.Stitches: Roll out a thin piece of black fondant and cut into 1 inch pieces. Place wherever you'd like onto the cake. I placed mine over the wrist gap. Don't forget to splatter some of the blood. Step 5: A Bloody Mess. <PIC> I made realistic blood my mixing maroon gel dye, strawberry cake filling, and water. You can add this anywhere to the cake. I put a large amount at the end of the arm to make it look like it was bleeding out. When placing the cake onto this sheet tray I decided to offset the hand which looked great. So, this is where I put the rest of the gorey blood. I hope that you all enjoyed this instructable.

I love love love it. Potatoes, cheese, and onions YEAH. :D\nThis hashbrown casserole came from my cousin Linda, which was passed to my mom and then to me. My mom made some small changes as did I. The end result is an over the top crazy delicious hashbrown casserole.\nBe careful with this one - too much and you're on a train to food-coma-ville. It's a happy but not very productive place. :) Step 1: Ingredients:. <PIC> \n\t\t2 lbs frozen shredded potatoes or freshly shredded potatoes (I actually used a few more handfuls on top of that!)\n\t\t1 can cream of chicken soup\n\t\t1 cup sour cream\n\t\t1 cup milk\n\t\t1/2 cup butter, melted\n\t\t1 onion, chopped\n\t\t2 cups grated cheese\n\t\tpepperTony's seasoning\u00a0(if you can't get Tony's where you are, order it! You will not be disappointed. :D)\nYou'll also need a 9x13 baking dish (glass works best) and an oven preheated to 350 F.\nChop the onion however big you like - I like mine a little chunkier. :D The cheese my mom recommends for this is a colby/jack mix, so I do that too. It's really good with anything that's not too smelly, though.\nI don't add any salt to mine (the butter, cheese and soup will all have lots) but I do like adding a bit of Tony's seasoning and some pepper.\nMy mom says that you can turn it into a meal by adding ham to the mix - I want to add bacon! I didn't think about it until it was too late. Someone please add bacon and send me pictures. :D Step 2: Defrost/shred the Potatoes. <PIC> If you're using frozen potatoes you'll need to defrost them. I put them in a large bowl and pop them in the microwave on the defrost setting - it took about 10 minutes to get them nice and defrosted.

Step 3: Preheat and Combine!. <PIC> Preheat the oven to 350 F.\nChop the onion and melt the butter.\nThen combine all the ingredients in your baking dish. Mix very well! You want the potatoes to be coated with everything. After it's mixed, press the potatoes flat in the dish. Step 4: Bake!. <PIC> Bake for 45 minutes at 350 F. After 45 minutes, it'll be done but looking kinda pale. If this doesn't bother you, chow down!\nIf you'd like a little more color, broil it on high for 5-10 minutes. I love doing this because it makes the top nice and crunchy. :D Step 5: Serve!. <PIC> Hashbrown casserole goes great with everything!

Step 3: Prepare Margarine. <PIC> you may not use all butter, you can put them on a bowel add salt and boil them till it has clear liquid and brownish solids. it may take an hour boiling.put that liquid in a jar (it is Margarine) when cool will turn to white solid margarine, put these solids in another jar with a table spoon of milk and mix them well (it is kind of cheese).now from the raw milk you have:pasteurized skimmed milk to drinkcreamsweetened whipped creambuttermilk for cookingMargarinecheeseand again the offer is to buy raw milk then have not only free package but also healthy food without chemicals and processing that kills nutrition values.(NOTE: This instructable is addressed to who live in states and countries where buying raw milk is legal)", "images_list": ["healthy-diary-package_0", "healthy-diary-package_1", "healthy-diary-package_2", "healthy-diary-package_3"]}

{"id": "RECIPE_602", "question": "What is the process for creating delightful S'mores French macarons from scratch?", "provenance": [40395], "ground_truth": "Introduction: S'mores French Macarons. <PIC> Macarons are tricky item to make. Most people need three tries to perfect these glorious cookies. Just keep trying, and you will see the amazing macarons you have made. Have fun, but be attentive;one wrong move, and you've ruined your cookes. Step 1: Mise En Place.  To start, you should have all your ingredients out. These are French cookies, so precision is key. You can weigh out ingredients, but I really don't have time for that. Measure out 3 egg whites, at room temperature, 1/4 cup of white sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar (optional), 1 cup of almond flour, or ground blanched almonds, 1 3/4 cups of confectioner's sugar, and 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. Sift together the cocoa, almond flour, and confectioner's sugar. Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit . If you cannot find cream of tartar, use a small squeeze of lemon juice. This will help stabilize your meringue, as cream of tartar would. Step 2: Making the Cookie. <PIC> Put your egg whites in a bowl of a stand mixer, or hand mixer with a whisk attachment, with the cream of tartar. Whip the egg whites until they get foamy. Start adding the sugar very gradually, about a tablespoon at a time. Keep whipping the egg whites for about 8 minutes. 8 minutes on my stand mixer could be different than yours. When you are done, the egg whites should be glossy, and hold a peak. To test, take off the whisk attachment, stir at the surface of the egg white mixture, and when you take the whisk out, the egg whites should be stiff.  MAKE SURE NOT TO OVER MIX THE EGG WHITES!!! If you do, there is no going back, and your egg whites will turn into white liquid. Over-mixing or under-mixing will ruin your cookie by either making them crack on top or spread out. Once you are done, add the dry mixture in by thirds. Fold the dry mixture in, not stir. This is where most people ruin their macarons, you cannot over mix the batter, or the shells will spread and flatten. If you undermix, your cookies will rise too much and crack on top. The consistency NEEDS to be like molten lava! Step 3: Piping the Cookies. Put about half your batter into a piping bag with a round tip. Pipe 2-3 inch little circles on parchment paper. You repeat with all your batter. Next, let these sit out to dry for 30 minutes in a dry area. Humidity will cause these fragile cookies to crack on top when they are baked. If you want your cookies to have the crisp, outer edge of a macaron while they rise in the ove, called feet, it is crucial they sit out. Bake them in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until they come of the paper without breaking. Let them cool off. If you do not know what macaron feet are, search perfect macaron on the internet, and just below the cookie, you will see the ring around the smooth top. That is a foot. Step 4: The Filling. Since macarons are sandwich cookies, they need a filling. You will need 3/4 cup of marshmallow fluff, 4 ounces of cream cheese, and 1- 2 cups of confectioners sugar, depending on how sweet you like your frosting. Fill in a piping bag and pipe in your macarons. Next, crush up some graham cracker and roll the frosting that oozes out of the macaron to catch the graham cracker crumbs.", "images_list": ["smores-french-macarons_0", "smores-french-macarons_2"]}

You can eat sprouts on their own raw, or cook them and add them to other dishes. You can even make flour from sprouted grains! :)In this instructable I'll cover how to sprout grains and beans on your own and what sorts of beans and sprouts are safe to eat raw.My absolute favorite things to sprout are quinoa, lentils and mung beans - they're great raw. :D Step 1: What You'll Need + Beans and Sprouts to Eat Raw. <PIC> (What I'm sprouting, left to right: quinoa, French lentils, brown rice, wheat berries, chickpeas - quinoa and French lentils are my favorites, though the wheat berries are really tasty too!)Equipment:quart sized mason jarscheeseclothBeans/legumes to sprout and eat raw:whole lentils (I'm using French green lentils)mungadzukichickpeasgreen peasGrains to sprout:wheat berriesquinoabrown ricebarleyThis page has a more complete list and lots of info!You can also sprout greens like alfalfa and clover, but I tend to just buy those because they're super easy to find and I save myself some effort. Keep in mind that there are certain beans that are toxic eaten raw, so always do your research before eating them raw. You can sprout and then cook them, however! Step 2: Soaking. <PIC> Please keep in mind that the grains/beans will swell when soaked, so make sure you never fill the jars more than 1/3 of the way full.You'll want to rinse the grains/beans and pluck out any rocks or odd colored pieces. Then pour them into jars and cover with cool water almost to the top.Cover with the cheesecloth and seal with the lid ring and let them soak at room temperature for 6-8 hours. Do this out of direct sunlight. :)I always lean more towards 8 hours, because that way I can go to sleep or head to work and let them soak while I'm doing something else.  Step 3: Draining + Rinsing. <PIC> After the initial 8 hour soak, pour out the soaking water and rinse the grains/beans very well. I like to set them over a baking sheet on a rack so that they can continue draining.For smaller grains like quinoa, you'll want to drain them really really well - otherwise they can get quite stinky! Holding the jars at a 45 degree angle lets them drain a little better.After the initial rinsing, let them sit upside down on the rack (or on a dish rack!) unless you're rinsing them. You'll want to rinse them 3-4 times a day and set them back to drain until they begin to sprout.  Step 4: Sprouting Times. <PIC> Most beans and grains will be ready within 48 hours, though some can take 4-5 days - Keep them rinsed and well drained during this time or the sprouts can go bad. In most cases, I stop sprouting them as soon as I see a little tail, anywhere from 1/8 - 1/2 inch. Brown rice takes a while longer, however - and the leafy green sprouts can do with another day in sunlight so they grow tiny shoots. :)Keep in mind that if you let the sprouting process go too long, you can alter the flavor in a huge way, and often not for the better. The length of time that you let them sprout will be something you figure out with a little trial and error. Step 5: Storing Your Sprouts. <PIC> To store your sprouts, first rinse them well in a sieve or colander and let them sit for a bit to remove most of the water. Then store them in a small container or a ziploc bag - pop a dry paper towel in there to leech out some of the moisture. You'll want to store them in the fridge and use them pretty fast - they can get funky quick! I always try to use them within 3-4 days.

This base recipe makes about 2 liters. Ingredients1/2 cup sugar - you can adjust this to taste and according to the sweetness of the  fruitWaterYeast - champagne or ale yeast.

Again this is flexible and you may use less or more.In large saucepan -  Bring a cup of water, sugar and salt to the boil. Step 2: Bottling. <PIC>  Add juice  to plastic 2 liter bottle. You can use glass, but it's good to fill a small plastic bottle out of each batch to help test when it's ready. With practice you will be able to use just glass.Top up with sugar syrup, lemon juice and extra water if needed. When cooled add a pinch of yeast. Give it a shake and leave in warm place. Let stand to 12 to 48 hours. Feel the bottle - when it is rock hard the soda is carbonated. Refrigerate now to stop fermentation. It needs to be stored in the fridge, so fermentation doesn't start again and over carbonate your bottle. After a day or 2 in the refrigerator it is ready to drink.  Step 3: Ready to Drink. <PIC> Open slowly - it may be really fizzy!Serve ice cold! Make any flavor you like.

WHY?  Because instead of dicing the ham in the usual fashion, I have ground it in a food processor and all of the other ingredients are soft (excluding the graham cracker pie crust, and that easily crumbles after being baked).

Shred 1/4 cup fresh Basil leaves.While it might appear that it takes a lot of steps to complete this recipe, the above 5 ingredients can be prepared leisurely; you can even prepare them the day before and refrigerate them until you are ready to make the quiche. Step 3: INSTRUCTIONS:. <PIC> Break the eggs into a small bowl. Add the whipping cream, black pepper & grated nutmeg and whisk intensely until well blended. In a large bowl, add the ground ham, grated Swiss cheese and chopped basil and mix with a fork or wooden spoon until well blended. Spread the 1 TBS of Dijon grainy mustard over the surface of the graham cracker pie crust. Add the ham, cheese, basil mixture to the \"pie\" and spread it around until it is level and even. Pour the egg mixture evenly over the top and sprinkle with the grated Parmesan cheese. Bake on the center oven rack at 350 degrees F for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the filling is set and lightly browned.

This recipe you are about to see is full of protein,\u00a0meaning it contains all 9 amino acids that your body cannot produce on its own.\u00a0 It's protein needed to fill you up and keep you full for 3 to 4 hours. You won't be munching on high sugar foods before lunch. It has been proven protein is the way to go for healthy weight control. A breakfast eaten with eggs can enhance weight loss by over 60 percent. A large egg generally provides 6.25 grams of protein each, when the yolk and white of the egg are both eaten. Also\u00a0cholesterol\u00a0is necessary\u00a0for the body. Your brain has 75% of it. It has been shown by resent studies that\u00a0cholesterol\u00a0is not the killer we thought.\u00a0Chronic\u00a0inflammation\u00a0is in first place. Most of the protein is in the whites of the egg. As for the yolk it has Lutein. Lutein fights against inflammation. Inflammation causes\u00a0arterial\u00a0hardening. Another ingredient in our recipe today that contains Lutien, is spinach. Did you ever see Popi with Chronic Inflammation? No, just lean muscles. For more about Lutien and Cardiovascular Health click here.\u00a0 Now let's get to making breakfast!!The author of this write-up is not a Doctor. The\u00a0nutritional\u00a0information provided is just that. Always\u00a0consult\u00a0a Medical\u00a0Practitioner\u00a0for your health needs. Sources of information: Living Strong Step 1: . <PIC> So here you can see on our cutting board we have 4 chefry\u00a0tomatoes\u00a0halved. One large egg, one garlic clove minced and\u00a0about\u00a01/8 cup of blended cheese shredded. The cheese I used is Sargento \"6 Cheese Italian\". But you can use any chesse you like. As for the greens, we have 5 spinach leaves with the ends cut off and some cilantro leaves chopped to\u00a0equal\u00a0one teaspoon. Please note the 1/8 cup of cheese provides 4.5 grams of\u00a0protein. So with that one egg and the cheese you now have about 11 grams of\u00a0protein\u00a0in this breakfast. Now let's\u00a0start\u00a0grabbing things off the board and get to cooking. Step 2: . <PIC> Heat some olive oil over medium heat. Once heated add garlic saute a little and then add the tomatoes and\u00a0saute\u00a0some more. By the way those tomatoes also have lutein in them. Which can help with eye health as well as skin health along with heart health. Step 3: . <PIC> Now add your spinach greens, the egg and top with the cheese. There's about 4 grams of protein in one cup of spinach. Those five leaves have about 1 gram raw and now that they are going to be cooked it will\u00a0double\u00a0to 2 grams. Our egg breakfast now has 12 grams of protein. Step 4: . <PIC> Put a lid over the pan and time it for one (1) minute, no longer. As a side note: If you like fried eggs, here is how to have the\u00a0perfectly\u00a0cooked fried egg every time. In a pan melt one teaspoon of butter over medium heat. Crack egg over butter, spoon in 1 to 2 tablespoons of water and put lid over egg. Let cook no less and longer, 1 minute. Remove from pan a plate your egg. It never fails,\u00a0perfectly\u00a0cooked egg all of the time. Do not use oil as your lid will shake and it looks like another Chernobyl\u00a0explosion\u00a0is going to happen. Do not add water with this recipe as well, the vegetables have some moister in them. The secret is the timing, 1 minute with lid and no longer. Step 5: . <PIC> I guess you are asking about the cilantro? Yes I forgot to sprinkle it over the finished egg before taking the image. So when you make this recipe, be sure to sprinkle the 1 teaspoon of chopped\u00a0cilantro\u00a0over the top of the Egg with Garlic and Spinach. Here are more great breakfasts with eggs.....

{"id": "RECIPE_647", "question": "What is the overall process for creating an edible white chocolate-coconut polar bear on a sugar cube igloo?", "provenance": [40426], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Edible White Chocolate-Coconut Polar Bear on Sugar Cube Igloo Sculpture. <PIC>   Winter is always fun with snowy days. When I was little I used to think that sugar cubes would be cool to make an igloo but never once made it. Now that I'm all grown up (still a child at heart) I finally decided it was time to make it. This edible sculpture is a nice tribute to winter. If you make it, hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it. Even better this is all edible so you can enjoy eating it too. Step 1: The Stuff You Need. <PIC>   To make this I just use what I had around the house and in the kitchen.\u00a0 I\u00a0  Materials:  1 small round bowl  1 large plate or cake turning table  1 box of sugar cube  2 lb powder sugar  1 toilet paper roll  black icing color or food dye  water  white melting chocolate  shredded coconut  \u00a0 Step 2: Making the Igloo. <PIC> To make the igloo: 1. For the base you need to flip a small bowl upside down on a plate. I used oil spray on the bowl and plate just to make the sugar glue not stick to it so much but it's optional if you desire. 2. For the sugar glue of the sugar cubes you need to mix in a bowl powder sugar and water.\u00a0Start \u00a0with 1-2 cups of powder sugar and\u00a01-2 tablespoon of water. Mix well until the consistence is like a paste.\u00a0 To test and ensure that it is not to watery, you can stack 2 cubes on each other with the sugar glue and side the top cube over.\u00a0 If the top cube still stays on top, the sugar glue is strong enough.\u00a0 Total amount of powder I used\u00a0was app 1.25 lbs.\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Stack the sugar cubes one by one\u00a0around the circumference of the bowl and using the sugar glue to attach them together.\u00a0 A few tricks I used were: -lightly compress with my hands around each level of cube I finished -use a fair amount of sugar glue but not so much that it is going to be too runny -at the top of the igloo I\u00a0pour sugar glue to on the inside cubes to stabilize them - at the highest level the cubes only stack up half way by,\u00a0cutting the hidden sugar cubes below it in half\u00a0before gluing them down 4.\u00a0 Allow the igloo to dry completely before adding the doorway in.\u00a0 To make the doorway cut the toilet paper roll to about 2/5 and use it as support.\u00a0 Stack and built the sugar cubes around it with sugar glue.\u00a0 Pull out the paper roll once the doorway is completely dry. Step 3: Making the Polar Bear. <PIC> I wanted a yummy polar bear so he's edible minus the toothpicks that hold his\u00a0body together. 1. Melt in microwave in 20 second increments 1/4 of the bag of white chocolate candy melts.\u00a0 Stir after each time in the microwave.\u00a0It does not need to be hot, just melted.\u00a0 2. Mix in 1/2 cup of shredded coconut.\u00a0 Then wait 3-5 minutes to allow chocolate to start to solidify again so that it is stiff but still pliable. 3.\u00a0 To build the polar bear roll out the body which tends to be more pear shaped, skinnier on top and thicker on the bottom.\u00a0 Use toothpicks for support to add the rolled arms and legs.\u00a0 For the head roll out a circle and then thin and taper one side for the face.\u00a0 Use 3-4 toothpicks for support.\u00a0 Add a tail and reinforce with toothpick too. Using a tiny amount of black food color add it to a tiny amount of sugar glue and roll out a triangular shape for the nose and 2 round eyes.\u00a0 Attach them onto face, they should stick relatively easily. Step 4: Finishing Touches. <PIC> Yay, the main components are done.\u00a0 1. Use sugar glue to glue down the polar bear to the top of the igloo. 2. Set out a thin layer of sugar glue around the igloo.\u00a0 Add fresh fallen snow by sprinkling by hand powder sugar around the igloo. This was such a fun piece to make the sweet winter sculpture.\u00a0 Might take a few days before I decide to share this by breaking it down and eating it.\u00a0 The sugar cubes will most definitely get hacked off cube by cube into a nice warm drink like hot chocolate by\u00a0a cozy fire.", "images_list": ["edible-white-chocolate-coconut-polar-bear-on-sugar_0", "edible-white-chocolate-coconut-polar-bear-on-sugar_1", "edible-white-chocolate-coconut-polar-bear-on-sugar_2", "edible-white-chocolate-coconut-polar-bear-on-sugar_3", "edible-white-chocolate-coconut-polar-bear-on-sugar_4"]}

Step 1: How to Prepare the Kafta Kebabs. <PIC> Kafta is ground beef mixed with parsley onions and spices, the taste is very similar to meatloaf.I usually buy the Kafta prepared by the butcher, so I don't have to chop the parsley and the onions.  If you want to mix it at home, I suggest to chop the parsley and the onions by hand, do not use a food processor other wise the vegetables will produce too much juice in the oven.  If you opt for a butcher prepared Kafta, ask the butcher to prepare it fresh and don't take pre-packaged Kafta. Equally important, is to ask the butcher for lean or extra-lean meat, or else they will shrink a lot in the oven and you'll end up with very small Kebabs.You will need 1 Kg of KaftaUse your hands to roll 20 Kafta balls Then place the Kafta ball in between your palms and shape them into 20cm kebabs (a little bit longer than a hotdog)Line the baking pans with parchment paper and place the kebabs in the pansCook them in the oven at 350 degrees for 25 minutesLet them cool then wrap them individually with plastic wrap and put them in freezer bags and freeze them.When you are ready to make a sandwich, remove one from the freezer, and heat it in a microwave for 2 minutes.I like to use flat bread to make sandwiches, but you can use whichever you like.The Kafta goes great with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, mustard and hot sauce.  Hummus is also delicious with Kafta.If you have a panini press go for it and enjoy your sandwich.Next is the Chicken BBQ Step 2: How to Prepare the Chicken BBQ. <PIC> The BBQ chicken does need an introduction.  Find a place that sells fresh BBQ chicken, I like places that include the garlic sauce with the chicken.I know that this step is messy but you have to do it.  Separate the meat from the bones and the skin with your hands.  If you like to eat the skin go ahead but don't freeze it, for some reason it is not as good when it thaws.Separate the chicken into individual packs using plastic wrap and put them in freezer bags and freeze them.When you have the itch to eat a chicken sandwich, remove a pack from the freezer and heat it in the microwave for 2 minutes per pack.In the sandwich you must have tomatoes and lettuce, pickles of some kind (I like pickled turnips with chicken), hot sauce and of course lots of garlic sauce.Panini press and enjoy.Until next time, eat well ..............", "images_list": ["bbq-chicken-and-kafta-kebab-sandwiches_0", "bbq-chicken-and-kafta-kebab-sandwiches_1", "bbq-chicken-and-kafta-kebab-sandwiches_2"]}

Do you want to make something new that people will be talking about for years? You have come to the right spot. I am going to take you step by step through the process of making your next amazing dessert. I am not in anyway a professional baker, but I do like to bake and come up with new desserts for my family to enjoy! This is actually the first Bundt cake I have ever made in my life. I was very nervous and wondered the whole time - Is this going to turn out right? Are you ready to try this taste bud tingling dessert? Let's get started! Step 1: Preperation. Whenever I start out making something new I read the instructions and make a list of all the items I may need to complete the job. This recipe is fairly simple and the only extra \"tools\" you would need is a Bundt pan and oven. You can find quality Bundt pans at www.nordicware.com . After reading how I make this sinfully good cake, I encourage you to make this recipe your own and tweak it with your own personal touch. The possibilities are endless and the flavor combinations are yours for the taking.  Step 2: Ingredients. <PIC> You will need the following items:Cake:1 box Vanilla Cake Mix1 box caramel pudding14 oz sour cream1/3 cup vegetable oil1/2 cup water1 1/2 cup white chocolate chips3 eggs Step 3: Optional Topping. Ingredients:Topping:1 bag of Kraft caramels 1 tablespoon milk1/2 cup white chocolate chipsThis topping is not required because the cake is so moist and rich, but if you can't get enough try using this simple caramel sauce. Step 4: Instructions. <PIC> Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.While your oven is heating up you are going to want to grease up your Bundt pan. You can use butter, shortening, or your own cake release concoction like the one found on thebearfootbaker.comIn a large bowl, combine all the cake ingredients except for the white chocolate chips. Give it a stir with a spoon then grab your mixer and mix on low speed for 30 seconds. Turn the speed up to medium and mix for another minute, or until the mixture is smooth. Stir in the white chocolate chips. Pour the mixture into your greased Bundt pan. Step 5: . <PIC> Put the filled Bundt pan in the oven and bake for around 50-55 minutes. You can test the middle of the cake with a toothpick. If the toothpick comes out clean your cake is set, if it is not clean then it needs to bake a little longer. When the cake is set pull it out of the oven and let is sit for 15 minutes. Grab a cake plate and place it over the Bundt pan. Flip it over and your cake will now be right side up on the plate.  Step 6: Icing. <PIC> While the cake is cooling you want to make the icing.Grab a saucepan and put it on the stove. Turn the stove on medium heat to heat the pan up a little bit. When the pan is warm add the unwrapped caramels and a tablespoon of milk. Stir constantly until all the caramels are melted. You want to keep stirring because the sauce will burn easily. You can add more milk to get it the consistency you desire. Next you are going to pour the caramel sauce over the Bundt cake.  Step 7: Finishing Touch. <PIC> The last step is adding the white chocolate chips. You can add them right after you pour the caramel sauce on the cake and the chips will melt slightly. If you want them to hold their shape more then just wait a couple minutes until the sauce cools down but before it hardens.*********WARNING!!!!! This is an amazing taste bud pleaser. If you have no self control than make sure there are people around to share this White Chocolate Caramel Cake. ****All Photographs courtesy of Carrie ***** Step 8: Feedback Is Always Welcome.

It's a quick simple and beloved Italian recipe.  To forewarn you there is a spicy kick but you can simply remove the chili pepper flakes.  There are very few ingredients making the sauce very light so don't expect a heavy sauce. The sauce is just a light coating of garlic oil.  The beauty of this dish is how the garlic infuses the olive oil with a hint of spice from the red pepper flakes.  I'm using parsley but if you don't like parsley, you can't swap it out for fresh basil or thyme.  The trick to making this dish successful is under boiling the pasta.  So if the package calls for 9 minutes, subtract a couple of minutes as you will be cooking this pasta in the sauce too.In this recipe, I'm using organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil by Terra Delyssa and Delverde Spaghetti Pasta.  Both of which are quality ingredients that I use time and time again.  Delverde Pasta is made in Italy and one of their missions is: \"To produce the best pure pasta from the purest water. This is the mission that we here at Delverde have pursued since the very beginning, in a setting that is close to nature and respectful of its values\". Some of their packaging is also biodegradable but not all.  Another great brand of Italian pasta I recommend is DeCecco as their boxes are recyclable.  You can source Terra Delyssa Olive Oil from Costco and Delverde at most major Canadian Retailers. Also if you're looking for a Eco-friendly cutting board, I'm using one by Architec. Their cutting board (see picture below) is \"Made of recycled food-grade plastic and premium flax husk blend, the Architec Poly-Flax Cutting board offers you a durable kitchen essential, and adds colour to your kitchen\". My husband purchased it at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Anyway I hope you guys enjoy this pasta recipe!  It's one of my go to dishes when I'm craving a pasta but don't want to invest the time to make a heavy sauce. Enjoy! Step 1: INGREDIENTS. <PIC> SERVES 3-4 | PREP TIME 5-7 MINS | COOK TIME 10 MINS1 pack of spaghetti (450 GRAMS) 1 small handful of flat Italian parsley chopped 1/2 tsp of red chili pepper flakes 6-8 garlic cloves thinly sliced 1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil1/2 cup of reserved hot pasta watersalt to taste Step 2: INSTRUCTIONS. <PIC> Boil your spaghetti in large pot filled with salted hot water.  To know how long you should boil it for: take the instructed cooking time and subtract 2 minutes. For instance, if the cooking time on the package says \"9 minutes\" subtract 2 minutes from that and you should only boil your pasta for 7 minutes total. Reserve 1/2 cup of hot pasta water.  Meanwhile in a large skillet set on medium heat, add your olive oil right away along with sliced garlic.  We want to slowly infuse the oil with the garlic.  Sweat the garlic until egdes become slightly brown.Add in chili flakes (optional) and then add in parsley or herb of your choice. Once pasta is cooked and strained, pour pasta into the skillet.  Pour in the hot pasta water and mix well until every noodle is coated in oil. Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately and garnish with some more chopped herbs.

This diet is very restrictive as you cannot have gluten, meat (except fish) dairy, anything too acidic, or worse of all, no alcohol. Well, in order to help me through the week making such restrictive meals I needed something I could make in a large batch, freeze and microwave when needed. I do love a good chilli and there's nothing in the rules against using a meat substitute, so the spicy cooking can begin! To bulk it out though I will be using plenty of beans, this reduces the requirement for meat substitute.. Step 1: Ingredients - Feel Free to Play About to Your Taste. <PIC> Provides approximately 6 portions, one for now, one for each day during the week (or keep in the freezer until required). 2-3 onions depending on size (mine were small so I used 3) 2 cloves of garlic, crushed or finely chopped 2 carrots, finely diced 2 sticks of celery, finely diced 2 grilled red peppers, chopped (I used some from a jar for speed) cooking oil 1 teaspoons of hot chilli powder, or to taste 1 teaspoon cumin, ground 1\u00a0 teaspoon cinnamon A fresh chilli pepper if you like it hotter a tablespoon of tomato puree (paste) 400g Cannelini beans, canned 400g red kidney beans, canned 800g chopped tomatoes (two regular cans) 500g Quorn, or meat substitute Balsamic vinegar or Worcestershire sauce Fresh coriander Sat and pepper Step 2: Preparation and Chopping Stuff. <PIC> We all know what proper planning prevents don't we? Get everything out ready to go. You'll need a large saucepan (or split everything equally between two if your pans are small). Get out a chopping board, knife, can opener, a sieve, stirring implement and your ingredients. Chop all the veggies up to a fairly fine dice, you may prefer yours chunkier, although the beans will add texture later. I like to empty my beans into a sieve and wash the canned sludge from them. Pop the saucepan on the hob and get the oil hot enough to begin frying the veggies. Step 3: Frying Stuff. <PIC> Begin frying the onion in the oil for a few minutes, whilst stirring. Next add the carrot, celery, garlic and fresh chilli if you're using. Fry this until the vegetables start to soften slightly. Next add the spices and stir through the vegetables. Next add the peppers and tomato puree, stirring in to mix with the spicy mixture. Now de-glaze the pan with a couple of teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. Step 4: Simmering Stuff. <PIC> Add the stock and tinned tomatoes, stir through to mix all the flavours. Now put in the beans, the saucepan might be quite full, so stir carefully. Put the meat substitute on the top of the mixture Bring the pot to a boil,, stir everything together, then reduce to gentle simmering Put the lid on and leave to simmer, stirring occasionally or at least half an hour You may want to put some rice on to cook, or prepare your accompaniments whilst this simmers. Step 5: Eating Stuff!. <PIC> Just before serving I like to add some fresh coriander for the clean punch it adds. You should also taste it before seasoning with salt and pepper. I served this very simply with boiled brown rice as that's in keeping with my Detox diet, although you may fancy some grated cheese, a dollop of creme fresh, soured cream or guacamole on yours. Corn Taco's are still allowed on my diet, so's guacamole, if only I had some :-(\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Best get back into the kitchen and put that right before I have my next batch.

Up in Northern Alaska, we catch Ocean Chum, King Salmon, Arctic Char, Silver Salmon and Pink Salmon (which I don't can).  I also travel to Southcentral Alaska to dipnet and fishwheel for King Salmon and Copper River Red Salmon, and the Kenai Sockeye run.  My husband is from Southeast Alaska and he travels there to catch King Salmon and Silver Salmon as well.  We smoke and can about 20 cases each year. Step 1: Get Salmon, and Fillet. <PIC> Up in Alaska, you just have to work hard to get salmon.  And most of the time it's free.  We set a net, and get 10-20 per night.  If you don't live in AK, or don't have access to free Salmon, you can purchase it as well.  Purchase fillets, we leave the skin and pin bones in. Step 2: Chunk and Brine. <PIC> Cut your fillets into 2\"-3\" chunks, from the tail upward.  We rinse and pat dry, then put into brine.Brine Recipe:4C Brown Sugar1C Pickling Salt1/4C Garlic Powder2 TBS Dried Dill1 TBS PaprikaMix the ingredients well, put 4-5 chunks of Salmon in the brine, and generously coat them, place skin side down in a pan, and sprinkle with more brine mix.  Repeat, with meat side down, until all your fish is brined, pour the rest of the brine on top, cover and refrigerate for 8 hours.  (We skinned these salmon for this brine mix)In the last photo, basically, all we do is get a cooler or tote that fits in the fridge (we do 8-10 fish, or 16-20 fillets at a time, so our tub is a 5 gallon one), line it with a trash bag, put ice on the bottom of the tote/cooler, place the bag inside, sprinkle brine mix on the bottom, chunk the fish, generously coat it in the brine mix, and put it in the bag.  Once finished with all the fish, we take out the air and tie the bag, put another bag of ice on top and close the cooler/tote.  After 8-10 hours, follow the next step.  Step 3: Rinse, Smoke, and Can. <PIC> Once the brine is done, rinse the fish well, pat dry with paper towel and lay on racks, skin side down.  I usually put a fan on the fish for about an hour or so, to dry until tacky.  This creates a sticky barrier for the smoke to adhere to called a pellicle.  Layer the fish on racks leaving about an inch or so between pieces, and smoke for 2-3 hours at temperatures between 120-140 degrees.  We use both a Traeger, a Little Chief and a homemade smoker.  All three work fairly the same.  Use what you have. (If you want Smoked Salmon that you are not going to can, you can smoke for 4-5 hours starting at 120 for two hours, 140 for two hours and 170 for an hour.  Vac seal and store in the freezer.)Once your fish is done, you can let it cool for a bit, while you sterilize your jars.  Pack the fish skin side out as closely together as possible without breaking too much of the salmon up.  Place new lids and close rings finger tight.  **If you want to add to your jars, this is the time to do it!  We add the following to about a case or two each:Per jar, add:2 TBS Homemade BBQ sauce, OR2 TBS Sriracha (or Frank's Red Hot, Or Tobasco) Sauce, OR2 TBS Homemade Teriyaki Sauce, OR3-4 Jalapeno slices Step 4: Pressure Cook. <PIC> Place your jars in the pressure cooker in layers on a canning rack.  We have two 24 quart pressure cookers that will do 14 pint size jars, or 21 half pint size jars at once.  Add your jars to the pot, fill to line with boiling water, place lid on, without weight, and bring to a boil.  Once boiling, turn the heat down and continue boiling until there is a steady flow of steam from the little pressure gauge.  We let it steam for about 5-10 min to build pressure and remove the excess air, then add the weight at 10 pounds of pressure.  Once the weighted gauge is on, set your timer for 90 min.  As long as the pressure is constant, the weighted gauge will jiggle 4 times per minute.  (I'm sure there are other instructions on how to can food properly, if all else fails, read the instruction booklet that comes with your pressure canner!)We turn off the heat at 90 min, and allow the canner to cool for 10-20 min. then release the excess steam on the canner.  We only do this with smoked salmon, not with moose or caribou, apparently it makes the meat tougher.  Remove the cans onto a cooling rack wipe out your canner, and get ready for the next batch! Step 5: Store in Cool, Dark Place. <PIC> Once your jars are cool enough to touch, all the lids should all have sealed.  After a few hours of cooling, if you find a lid that has not sealed, either eat it immediately, or place in the refrigerator to eat within a week.  All the other jars will are shelf-stable for 1-3 years.  (Although our 20 cases a year never last over 52 weeks!)Feel free to make yourself a canned salmon throne when finished, and take a photo, like this of my husband.The fish we can are as follows:King Salmon, Ocean Chum Salmon, Arctic Char, Sockeye Salmon, and Silver Salmon.

As such, these probably aren't the most authentic of English muffins (especially since I don't have any cornmeal here in res), but are merely an attempt to make a stove-top bread that will toast nicely and soak up the gooey goodness of a perfectly-cooked egg. The texture is holey, but softer and less chewy than the store-bought kind. Either way, they are super yummy!\nBeing a collegiate meal, these are no-knead, super easy, and make a small portion that's enough for just you and your roommates. Of course, you could scale up the recipe. Total prep/cooking time is probably about an hour with some washing and waiting time in between.\nOnward! Step 1: Ingredients and Tools. <PIC> Edibles:\n~1 1/8 cup all-purpose flour\n1/3 cup milk (I used 2% here, but you can use anything. I bet buttermilk would add an awesome tangy-ness)\n1/3 cup water\n1 tbsp butter\n1/8 tsp instant yeast\n1/8 tsp salt\ncornmeal for dusting (optional. I didn't have any on hand) Non-edibles:\nspatula (one for working the dough, another for working the griddle)\nmeasuring cups\nrolling pin (I used a cylindrical glass)\nround cookie cutter (or try the lip of a cup or as\u00a0tayzzmom suggests - \u00a0a tuna can with the ends cut out)\nworking surface (I worked on a cutting board and some parchment because our counter is nasty)\nplastic container for rising (yogurt container works for me)\ngriddle (frying pan works too. just need lots of cooking space)\nmicrowaveable cup\nAs you can probably tell, being a student requires some craftiness. Just use whatever tools you have lying around. Step 2: Mix and Rest. <PIC> Start this process the night before you want to eat the muffins.\nMeasure out 1 cup of flour by scooping and leveling out with a knife. Add it to your plastic container. I am usually a huge proponent for using a scale because it's much more accurate, but we'll make do here. To deal with this loss of accuracy, take out another 1/4 cup of flour and have it standing by.\nAdd the 1/8 tsp each of instant yeast and salt to the flour. Mix it briefly.\nMeasure out 1/3 cup each of milk and water and put it into a mug. Add the tbsp of butter to this. Pop it in the microwave for 15-30 seconds or until it's somewhere between lukewarm and warm.\u00a0 The butter will be just starting to melt. Mix in the butter and add all of the liquid to the flour mixture.\nMix with a spatula, spool, hand, or whatever. My dough was too wet at this point, so I added about 1/8 of a cup from the flour that was reserved earlier. Mix some more. The dough should be quite soft and somewhere between sticky and tacky. It will get less sticky as it rests, don't worry. The high ratio of liquid to flour is needed to ensure nice big holes in the final product.\nOnce the dough has come together, just scrape down the sides of the container and lid it up. You don't really have to worry about mixing too much or too little, Whenever you think it's thoroughly mixed, it's good.\nNow let it sit at room temperature (my room was 22.5 degrees C) for 12 hours or so. Step 3: Fold, Rest, Cut, Rest. <PIC> The next morning, the dough will have doubled in size. Turn it out onto a (cornmeal) floured surface and fold to redistribute the nutrients for the yeasty beasties. You just enough flour to prevent sticking.\nTo fold (see video also):\n- grab one side of the dough, stretch it out and fold it over just past the midline\n- repeat for the opposite side\n- repeat for the other two sides\nTurn it seam side down, cover, and let rest for 10 minutes. I just covered it with a cereal bowl, but you could use plastic wrap or a tea towel too.\nAfter resting, the gluten will have relaxed a bit. You can now roll it out to about 1 cm or slightly over 3/8 inches in thickness.\nThen take your cookie cutter or cup and punch out rounds and transfer them to another floured surface.\nTake the leftover scraps, stick them together, roll out, and punch more rounds. If you used too much flour on your surface (not so much of an issue for corn meal), it might be hard to get the scraps to stick back together, so use only what you need. Also, if the dough is too elasticy, it may be necessary to let the dough rest a bit before rolling it out again.\nCover the dough circles with a sheet of plastic or a tea towel and let it rest for 30 minutes. During this time, clean up some of the mess you have made, brew a coffee, and heat up the griddle over medium heat. Step 4: Cook and Eat. <PIC> After 30 minutes, the dough circles will have puffed up a little. Proceed to cooking!\nSprinkle some more cornmeal on the dough and arrange onto the hot griddle (medium heat). Use a flat spatula and try to avoid compressing the dough. We want to keep them nice and puffy!\nLeave at least an inch between each piece. If you do not have cornmeal like me, brush the surface of the griddle with a thin layer of oil to prevent sticking. (I tried butter at first, but it got too smoky. Maybe clarified butter would be better).\nCook on each side for about 8 minutes. It may take a bit longer if your dough was thicker than 1 cm when you cut it.\nIf eating immediately, let them rest until you can handle them without burning yourself (about 5 min). You can cut them in half, toast and butter them, make eggs Benedict, or whatever else suits your fancy :)\nIf you want to store them, let them cool all the way to room temperature and seal in an airtight container or bag. You can keep them at room temperature for a couple of days or cut and freeze them for later use. Toast them straight from frozen state.\nEnjoy!", "images_list": ["collegiate-meals-no-knead-english-muffins_0", "collegiate-meals-no-knead-english-muffins_1", "collegiate-meals-no-knead-english-muffins_2", "collegiate-meals-no-knead-english-muffins_3", "collegiate-meals-no-knead-english-muffins_4"]}

Turmeric and Ginger are my two favorite herbs to use for general health function and prevention of so many health problems. Turmeric\u2019s effects are greatly improved with ginger and black ground pepper as well as some fat, such as coconut oil (since some say it is fat soluble). The fat and pepper increases their bioavailability of the two herbs considerably when used together (I have read, up to 2000 times more bioavailability.)They are both great anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal/bacterial. Some of the benefits of each are below. Turmeric has even been shown to be more effective than 14 prescription drugs.Instructions for Turmeric and Ginger Tea:- Peel the Ginger or Turmeric root with spoon or peeler   - Cut into small pieces, place in pot of water   - Boil water, then simmer for 20 minutes   - The first batch can be very peppery depending on the ratio of water to ginger that you use.   You can also add cinnamon, mint, or honey for taste.If you are using ground powder Turmeric, then just add that to your cup, not in the pot. Then you add the black ground pepper or the coconut oil, or just eat a tablespoon of the coconut oil first (this has many benefits in itself). I continue adding water to the pot with ginger in it, until it becomes clear, getting the most from the root. This is usually about a week or so of a few cups a day.See Part One to learn the benefits of herbal tea and 15 powerful herbal teas and their benefits.Ginger root can be found in most supermarkets  Ground Ginger Powder can be found here:Starwest Botanicals Ginger Root Powder Organic, 1-PoundTurmeric Root can be found in many health food markets or purchased here:Fresh Yellow Turmeric Root - 1lbTurmeric Powder can be found here:Starwest Botanicals Organic Turmeric Root Powder - 1 lbsSome of the Benefits of Ginger:Ginger can help to calm a nervous or upset stomach, has a calming effect, can help promote general healing while starving off disease, improve digestion by aiding in the breakdown of proteins and fats helping to prevents gas and food buildup, can help lower blood pressure, ease morning sickness, nausea and vomiting, help lower cholesterol, help with type 2 diabetics, reduce cancer risk, blood thinner that protects against stroke and blood clots, helps prevent and relieve cold and flu, can relieve severe joint and muscle pain, relieve menstrual pain, PMS and PMDD, reduce headaches, migraines, promote kidney health and more.Some of the Benefits of Turmeric:A common healing herb in both Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic Medicine, studies have revealed over 600 potential preventive and therapeutic applications as well as 175 distinct beneficial physiological effects.

{"id": "RECIPE_725", "question": "What are the key steps to measure the alcohol content in homemade beer or wine using a hydrometer?", "provenance": [40474], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Measuring Alcohol Content With a Hydrometer. <PIC> The first couple times you brew your own beer or wine, you're more concerned about the end product - delicious, delicious alcohol. The exact amount is only a secondary concern.As you start getting more and more into the hobby, knowing the percent alcohol can be useful. Both for knowing what to expect in your final product, but also for monitoring progress in the fermentation process.In this Instructable, I will go over how to use a hydrometer to take density measurements of your brew, and how to transform these density measurements into a more familiar percent alcohol.You will need:A Hydrometer  Sterilizing Equipment  Something to Measure  Pipette or Baster to Take a Sample Step 1: Your Hydrometer. <PIC> A hydrometer is a tool used for measuring density. Hydrometers used for brewing will tell you the specific gravity of a liquid - a ratio of the liquid's density to that of water. Something with a SG of less than 1 is less dense than water (and will float), and something with a SG of above 1 is more dense and will sink.The hydrometer is essentially a specially weighted bob - you place it in a liquid, and it will sink to a certain depth, which depends on the density of the liquid. My seeing how far it sinks, you can determine the liquid's density.Since alcohol has a different density than the sugar/water mixture you started with, you can calculate the percent alcohol by measuring the initial SG and the final SG. Step 2: Sanitizing. <PIC> As with any homebrewing project, sanitation is critical. There's nothing worse than an infected brew.Before beginning, mix up some sanitizer. I personally use Easy Clean, and mix up a one gallon batch following the instructions on the back (one tbsp per gallon warm water). Easy Clean is a no-rinse sanitizer, meaning that it isn't necessary to rinse your equipment after cleaning them (which could potentially reintroduce bacteria).Sanitize all the equipment you'll be using - the hydrometer, the hydrometer tube, and whatever you'll be drawing your sample with. And of course, thoroughly wash your hands before continuing. Step 3: Measuring. <PIC> First, place the freshly sanitized hydrometer in its tube. Using your sampler, draw off a small sample of your brew from the middle.Begin filling the hydrometer tube until the hydrometer begins to float freely, and then stop filling. If your equipment was properly sanitized, it is safe to return the excess liquid.Place the hydrometer on a flat, level surface, and gently spin the hydrometer back and forth to release any bubbles that may have formed on its surface. Ensure the hydrometer is floating freely, and is not touching the sides of the hydrometer tube.From eye-level, read the hydrometer's measurment from the bottom of the meniscus. The meniscus is the curved surface caused by surface tension - and can make a significant difference in your results if you are not consistent.Note down your reading, and the date the measurement was taken.From here, you can return the sample to the larger brew, assuming all the equipment was properly handled and sanitized. Step 4: Calculation. Now, it's time to turn the specific gravity readings into a useful number.For an approximate estimation, the magic number is 131.25. Your percent alcohol can be given by the formula:ABV(%) = (Initial Gravity - Final Gravity) * 131.25.So if your initial gravity was 1.108, and your final gravity was 1.041, your beer is approximately 8.79% alcohol by volume.Once again, this is only an approximation, and loses accuracy as the alcohol content goes up. For a more precise number, or if you're brewing something particularly strong, there exist a number of online calculators that can do the heavy lifting for you.Thanks for reading, brew and enjoy responsibly!", "images_list": ["measuring-alcohol-content-with-a-hydrometer_0", "measuring-alcohol-content-with-a-hydrometer_1", "measuring-alcohol-content-with-a-hydrometer_2", "measuring-alcohol-content-with-a-hydrometer_3"]}

Step 1: The Ingredents. <PIC> \n          What you will need for the chocolate macarons:\u00a0\n\n\t\t85g (3/4\u00a0cup roughly)\u00a0of Almond flour (you might be able to find at Wal-mart, or Meijer, but I know you will find it at a natural foods store such as Rainbow Blossom or even Trader Joe's)\n\t\t225g (2 cups roughly) Confectioners\u00a0sugar\n\t\t4 eggs - at room tempature <-- very important!\n\t\t50g (1/8th cup roughly) Caster\u00a0sugar\u00a0(can be made by running normal sugar through a food processor, it just makes the crystals very small, Do Not substitute\u00a0confectioners\u00a0sugar)\n\t\t3 tbsp of cocoa powder Step 2: Preperation and Mixing. <PIC> \n          Mixing the cookies must be done in a precise\u00a0order :\n\n\t\tMix together the almond flour,\u00a0the confectioners sugar, and cocoa powder\u00a0in a bowl.\n\t\tIn a\u00a0separate\u00a0mixing bowl place the egg whites and whip them untill it begins to foam.\n\t\tAdd in the caster\u00a0suger slowly.\n\t\tWhip the egg whites and caster sugar to\u00a0form\u00a0it into meringue.\n\t\tAfter the meringue is formed fold the almond flour mixture into the egg mixture carefully. \u00a0You want to keep as much air in the\u00a0meringue\u00a0as you can. Step 3: Piping & Baking. <PIC> \n          This is the step that will take the most amount of skill and timing. \u00a0\nYou have to either use parchment paper or a silpat mat, Wax paper will not work as a subistute. \u00a0\nYou are going to spoon your\u00a0macarons mixture into a piping bag with a 1/2\" tip. \u00a0When you are piping these onto a silpat/parchment paper you are going to want to bring the tip of the bag straight up and make a little clockwise twist to flatten the peak that will form. here is a video of the technique.\u00a0 You will want the dots to be about 2 cm across or about the size of a US nickle, and about 2\" apart. \u00a0(This is not my video, just one I found on\u00a0YouTube)\nAfter they have been piped onto the silpat/parchment paper, lift the tray up slightly and let it drop to bring any large bubbles that may have formed when piping. \u00a0You will want to let them sit for about 10-20 Minutes for a skin to form on the top of the dots, this way when you bake them they will have a round top to them and have a bubbly ring at the bottom.\nMidway\u00a0through\u00a0the skin formation you can heat you oven up to 300\u00baF (150\u00baC).\nYou will bake them for 12-15 minutes, you will know when they are done by the formation of a bubbly ring around the bottom of the\u00a0macarons. If you are baking in an electric over place them on the bottom or middle rack.\nAfter they have baked take them out and let them sit for about 5 minutes before removing them from the baking trays and transfer them to a wire cooling rack. \u00a0If you are using parchment paper, take a spray bottle with water and lightly mist the pan\u00a0underneath\u00a0the paper and the resulting steam will loosen them up for easy removal when the time comes.\n         Step 4: The Filling. <PIC> \n          For the filling you can make a variety of fillings for the macarons: I am going to go with a basic chocolate ganache. \u00a0You can make the Ganache filling with the following ingedents:\n\t\t1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream\n\t\t4 oz\u00a0of your choice of chocolate either white, dark, or semi-sweet. It\u00a0has to be baking chocolate, chocolate chips will not work.\n\t\t1 tbsp of butter\nBring the cream to a boil and stir in the chocolate to melt it. \u00a0After all of the chocolate has melted then stir in the tbsp of butter while it is still hot, after that just place the ganache in the fridge to cool. \u00a0The more the ganache\u00a0cools\u00a0the thicker it becomes. When it has cooled scoop it into a piping bag and place a small amount of the ganache (about a teaspoon) onto one half of a macarons, now take a half the is about the same size and twist them together.\n         Step 5: Other Ideas. \n          Here are some other variations of macarons you can make.\n\n\t\tAlmond: Substitute the 3 tbsp of coco powder for 1/4 cup of the almond flour\n\t\tCoconut: Substitute 2 tbsp of unsweetened finely ground coconut\u00a0for tbsp of the\u00a0almond flour and add 1/2 tsp of rum\n\t\tPistachio: Substitute 1/2 cup of finely ground unsalted\u00a0pistachios\u00a0for 1/2 cup of\u00a0almond flour\n\t\tVanilla Bean: add 1/2 tsp of extract and 1/2 of a vanilla beans pulp\nFor the filling you can use jams or other sweeter fillings.\n        ", "images_list": ["chocolate-french-macarons_0", "chocolate-french-macarons_1", "chocolate-french-macarons_2", "chocolate-french-macarons_3", "chocolate-french-macarons_4"]}

The last thing I want to do is turn on my oven when the need to bake strikes. So I've decided to take my slow cooker for a whirl to bake some deliciously cheesy beer bread. Step 1: Equipment. <PIC> Ingredients1 bottle of beer at room temperature1 cup (125g) grated cheddar cheese5 teaspoons baking powder2 2/3 cups plain flourNotesIf you have self-rising flour, use that instead of the plain flour and baking powder.I grated about 125g of cheese and it was just over a cup.I recommend using the sharpest cheddar you can find, especially if you\u2019re using a hoppy beer as the flavours complement each other really well.  The flavour of the cheese is a bit muted once the bread is cooked so use sharper cheddar than you\u2019d normally pick.EquipmentImage 1Large BowlSpatulaCheese graterDry measuring teaspoonMeasuring cups (1 cup and 1/3 cup)Baking paperImage 2Bamboo skewer(s)Slow Cookercake tin (or just the sides from a spring form tin) \u2013 OptionalNot PicturedTimer (I used my phone alarm) Step 2: Preparation. <PIC> Take your beer out of the fridge and allow it to come up to room temperature.Then line your slow cooker with baking paper. I used the sides from my spring-form cake tin to create a mold for my bread. However you can use whatever type of cake or loaf tin that will fit in your slow cooker; or if you want a more artisan style loaf then forgo a tin altogether. If you don\u2019t have any baking paper you could try oiling your pans / tins / slow cooker with some cooking spray. However I have never done this as I find clean up so much easier with baking paper. Step 3: Mix. <PIC> In a large bowl combine your plain flour and baking powder (or if you\u2019re using self-rising flour then place it in a large mixing bowl). Stir in your grated cheese. Make a well in the middle then pour in your beer and mix well. It will take several minutes but you will end up with a large ball of sticky dough.Plop your dough into your slow cooker. I used my spatula and my hand to flatten my dough and push it to the sides of my cake tin. To prevent the dough from sticking to you when you touch it either dust your hands with flour or wet your hands a little bit. Step 4: Bake. <PIC> The first time you bake in your slow cooker you\u2019ll need to keep a close eye on your loaf. It took 1 Hour and 45 minutes for mine to bake. However my beer was cold, our bread may be a different shape and our slow cookers are probably different so our cooking times probably differ.Set your slow cooker to its highest setting / quickest cooking time.  Check on your bread after 1 hour and then every 30 minutes thereafter until it\u2019s ready.  Your bread is ready when:the top is no longer sticky. It will have gained a touch of colour but will still be pale and softthe bread will come away a from the paper lining a littlethe bottom will be a lovely golden browna skewer inserted will come out fairly clean. It may come out slightly sticky due to all the melted cheese inside.If you would like a browned crunchy crust then stick your loaf under the broiler / grill for a few minutes. I left my loaf as it was as I liked that it looked like a wheel of cheese to match it delicious cheesy taste. Step 5: Enjoy. <PIC> It\u2019s time to enjoy the fruit of your labour.While it is nice on its own or in a cheese platter, it\u2019s delicious with some caramelised onions and balsamic vinegar.

Everyone should have their ultimate dream cake on their birthday. This was mine! I wanted a 6- layer fun-fetti cake. Something colorful and covered in goodies. While I knew what I wanted I've never attempted such a tall cake or a cake such a colorful cake topped with everything but the kitchen sink. I wasn't sure how I was going to do it, so as always - I free styled the design and went with the flow. Here I used my favorite strawberry cake mix by Pillsbury and a homemade vanilla cake. The recipe for the vanilla cake is below. Watch the video above for a step by step tutorial. You'll Need:White Chocolate GanacheConfetti Candy (2 types)Pocky (Strawberry and Chocolate)FlowersLicorice CandyUnfrosted Blueberry PoptartBlue and Pink Cotton CandyVanilla ButtercreamGel Dye: Pink, Blue, and PurpleSlanted offset spatulaCake Scraper or Bench Scraper--------Vanilla Cake Recipe by Ricardo Cuisine:  3 cups (750 ml) unbleached all-purpose flour   1 tablespoon (15 ml) baking powder   1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) salt   4 eggs   2 cups (500 ml) sugar   1 tablespoon (15 ml) vanilla extract   3/4 cup (180 ml) canola oil   1 1/4 cup (310 ml) milk Step 1: Strawberry Cake. <PIC> Feel free to use whatever cake flavor you'd like here, after all it's your cake.Out of the two boxes of cake mix that I used, I only used 1 bag and 1/2 of another bag. Meaning that for the second box, I halved the ingredients needed and actually saved that 1/2 for funfetti cookies. Prepare cake mix as stated on the box. Divide between three cake pans and bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes.  Step 2: Vanilla Confetti Cake. <PIC> With the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 180 \u00b0C (350 \u00b0F). Butter three 9 inch cake pans and line the bottom with parchment paper. Set aside. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. In another bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer for about 10 minutes or until thick, pale and triple in volume. Drizzle in the oil while beating. At low speed, add the dry ingredients alternately with the milk until the batter is smooth. Add confetti candy and divide batter into pans.Bake at 350 for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool for 15 minutes. Remove from the pans and let completely cool on a wire rack. If necessary, cut and remove the cake tops to level each cake before frosting. Step 3: Stack and Fill. <PIC> By now all of the cake layers should be completely cooled.Alternate cake layers and fill with vanilla buttercream. I made 6 total layers which was wonderfully tall. Dye half of the buttercream pink and the other half blue. You can also set a small amount of vanilla buttercream aside to use for decoration later on. With a spatula smear half of the cake pink and half blue. Also cover the top in buttercream. Use a ruler or large cake scraper to create a smooth surface for the cake and blend the two colors together.  Step 4: Decorations. <PIC> To make the drip top, make a chocolate ganache by melting white chocolate in cream. Color the ganache and whisk until completely smooth. Pour a good amount on top of the cake and push to the edges with the spatula. Allow the ganache to drizzle down.Sprinkle one side with confetti candy and place pocky sticks on top and around the bottom. I topped the cake with purple flowers and vanilla buttercream swirls. Lastly, I added pieced of blueberry poptarts, blue and pink cotton candy and licorice candy.

Step 1: Collect Up and Prepare Ingredients. <PIC> You will need:\n25g gelatine powder\n4 tsp rose water\n450g white sugar\n4 drops red food colouring\nAnd also 200ml water (thanks to Hoopajoo for pointing out the missing ingredient)\nAnd for dusting the set turkish delight:\n4 tbsp icing sugar mixed with\u00a02 tsp cornflour Step 2: Mix, Dissolve and Simmer. <PIC> Get out a big saucepan and add the gelatine, sugar, rose water and water.\nGently heat until it is all dissolved.\nOnce dissolved, bring to the boil without stirring. You don't want to stir it because this will cause the mixture to foam up and form sugar suds on top. Simmer for 20 to 25 min.\u00a0\nWatch it carefully\u00a0- During the making of this turkish delight, I turned away for literally 30sec and ended up having to scrub burned suger syrup off the hotplate.

Step 3: Colour, Set, Slice and Dust. <PIC> Remove from the stove, let cool for 5 min and then add the food colouring.\nScrape off the suds from the top - these suds will not go away by themselves.

{"id": "RECIPE_750", "question": "What\u2019s the best way to prepare delicious homemade crumpets that are perfect for butter melting into them?", "provenance": [40489], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Crumpets. <PIC> \n          Crumpets are a traditional British staple to be enjoyed smothered in butter, by the fire with a proper pot of tea. They sit somewhere between bread, pancake and an (English) muffin with a spongy, open texture. Their primary purpose is as a butter-delivery device (although some people also enjoy them with other toppings). When they turn out well, the big holes go most of the way through and the melting butter oozes out of the bottom -- gotta be fast before it all gets away! To make 12-25 (depending on size of rings) you'll need:   A cast-iron skillet or large frying pan     Crumpet rings (or egg rings) to contain the batter     450g plain flour     350ml warm milk (at body temperature)     350ml warm water (at body temperature)     5g yeast     10g of salt (this will look like a lot but it's essential!)     1 tsp baking powder     Butter for greasing (and melting into the end result)  Step 1: Make the Batter. <PIC> Whisk together the flour, liquids and the yeast. Do not add the salt or baking powder at this stage, it inhibits the yeast. Set the mixture aside for a couple of hours in a warm room until it's lovely and bubbly. You can leave it for only 1 hour if you're short on time or up to 5 hrs if you're not (leaving it longer will give you a touch more sourness). Once the batter has bubbled up and you're ready to cook them, whisk in the salt and the baking powder. The baking powder gives the batter the kick that makes the big holes. Step 2: Cooking the Crumpets. <PIC> \n          Heat a cast-iron skillet over a medium heat. The heat is pretty critical and it'll take a few trial runs to get it spot on. I recommend using a large gas ring but turned down to about 30% power. The big burner helps to spread out the heat - a small ring gives you a small heat spot in the middle which will cook very unevenly. Grease the rings with butter and put them on the pan, grease the pan in the middle of the ring. You want the butter to sizzle when it hits the pan but not smoke. Start with a trial run:   Fill a ring half full (the batter puffs up a lot as it cooks).     It should take about 5 minutes for bubbles and then holes to appear on the top.     Once the top has just set, flip the ring and toast the top.  If bubbles don't appear then your batter may be too thick. Whisk in a little water and try again. If the batter takes too long to set then the pan may be too cold, turn up the heat slightly. If the bottom burns before the top has set or you get smoke, the pan is too hot, turn it down slightly. If the batter is the right thickness then there really is a critical temperature where it will bubble and set but not burn! Once you've got it dialled in, start making batches of about 4 at a time. It's easier to keep the temperature constant when you have 4 or more crumpets in the pan at once. Step 3: Serve (or Store). <PIC> Crumpets should really be eaten straight away with butter melting into the holes. However, with the rings I have (which are a little too small), this recipe makes about 25 crumpets. That's too much even for me. If, like me, you can't manage them all as they come off the griddle, then you can cool them on a wire rack and then store them in a plastic bag. Just pop them in the toaster to rejuvenate them before serving. \u00a0They also freeze well. Enjoy!", "images_list": ["crumpets_0", "crumpets_1", "crumpets_2", "crumpets_3"]}

I\u2019ve never tried any as I don\u2019t buy them, but I don\u2019t see why not.Without the egg? well, Mr Google is a clever bloke and has some suggestions you could try.Most importantly, will blueberries work?

Ever since I first tried them in Spain several years ago I get regular cravings for them. You can get them over here but they're so expensive that they're difficult to justify. However, I have recently found out how to make them for myself and I can't believe how simple they are. With a straight forward method and cheap ingredients there's no doubting that these tasty treats are going to be making a regular appearance in my house. If you can get your head around a simple bread dough you'll have no difficulty with these. The literal translation is 'oil cakes' but that doesn't sound as good as the Spanish original. My understanding of their history is that they are a traditional sweet from Seville in southern Spain but are now enjoyed all over the world.\nIf you enjoy this recipe please check out my blog for more food ideas.\u00a0http://eating-properly.blogspot.co.uk/ Step 1: Ingredients.

Thandai (pronounced Than as in thunder,dai as in die) is such a drink my dear fellows.\u00a0 Thandai is a native & popular cold drink in India and is traditionally prepared as a religious offering to Lord Shiva on the occassion of\u00a0 Mahashivratri and also during Holi (the festival of color).\u00a0 During these festivals it is also mixed with Opium (powder or paste) to make it an intoxicating drink. We will not do that here :) There is no equivalent word for Thandai in English but you can consider it a refrigerant because it helps keep your body cool. Every year we celebrate Mahashivratri at home and make this divine drink (in reality we make it anytime, because it tastes so good). Therefore this recipe is native to my family but I will be honest, most of the ingredients are just common and process is just shifting of steps here & there. I love this drink over any unnatural (made using essence and chemicals) drink because it is all natural and healthy, packed with protein, health fats (a.k.a essential fatty acids) and fiber. Once you had its taste, I am sure it will become your favorite summer drink, even kids love it.Useful information: Preparation Time: 3-4 hours (only for refrigeration) Cooking: 15 mins Servings: 3-4 Vegan: No (Try almond milk or Soy, I have not tried it though) Vegetarian: Yes Lets make this divine drink.UPDATE July 23, 2013: I have found a very detailed article about the health benefits of Thandai, now you can enjoy it even more without any guilt ;-). Check it out here:\u00a0 Time Of India. I noticed they mentioned pumpkin seeds here instead of Melon seeds. Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> \n          You will love to know the ingredients   Full fat or whole milk 500 ml (16.9 oz.) (This is the traditional ingredient, you can use low fat milk too, it works well)     Powdered Sugar\u00a0 1/2 cup (I do not like it too sweet)     Saffron\u00a0 a few strands (I use little more) For paste:   Almonds,blanched and peeled\u00a0 20     Cashewnuts\u00a0 15     Pistachios Kernals\u00a0 20     Melon seeds (Magaj in Hindi) 3 tablespoons. Soaked for 20-30 minutes.     Poppy seeds (khus-khus in Hindi) 3 tablespoons. Soaked for 20-30 minutes.     Fennel (Saunf in Hindi)seeds 1tbsp. Soaked for 20-30 minutes. For powder:   Green cardamoms\u00a0 4 to 6     Dried Rose petals\u00a0 15-20 (If you don't have them). Damascus Rose works best because of its exotic fragrance.   Black peppercorns\u00a0 4 to 6 To garnish:   A few chopped pistachio     A few fresh or dried rose petals Optional:   Fresh Cream to add more texture Kitchen Tools:   A big pan to boil milk     Mixer grinder     A refrigerator     Mortar and pestle (Don't worry if do not have it, you can simply crush the ingredients for powder)  Step 2: Making That Divine Paste and Powder. <PIC> Making the paste: Once you have the soaked ingredients along with other\u00a0aforementioned ingredients for the paste (Image 1). Make paste by adding a little milk and grinding it till it forms a smooth creamy paste (Image 2).NOTE: You can keep this paste in refrigerator to use later for few days.Making the powder (Image 2): Sadly : My dried rose petals became moist so I did not use them here, but we will use some fresh petals while garnish. Use Mortar and pestle to crush all the ingredients of the powder (Image 3). It does not have to be super fine :).NOTE: You can also keep this powder for later use Keep the powder and paste aside. Lets do little cooking Step 3: Cooking and Mixing the Flavourful Elements. <PIC>  Now turn on your stove and put milk in a boiling pan and proceed as follows:    Bring it to boil (Image 1).     Add saffron.and mix (Image 1)     When the milk starts to boil again, add sugar (Image 2).     Simmer till the sugar is mixed.     Add the paste and simmer for 2-4 minutes, strring continously\u00a0(Image 3).     Remove the pan from stove     Transfer the content to another pan, add the powder (Image 4) and let it cool.     Once the milk is cooled, refrigerate it for 3-4 hours to make it chilled. NOTE 1: Before you remove the content from stove, take a drop of the final content and taste it for sugar, if you think it is lesser, add more powdered sugar to suit your taste and mix well.NOTE 2: After cooling (not chilling), the final content may become thick. Do not worry, just add some milk till you get desired consistency and mix well, taste for sugar, if you think it has become less sweet, add more and stir well.NOTE 3: You can add more milk plus a little water while boiling if you like a lighter consistency. \u00a0 Almost done here.\n         Step 4: Serving the Delight. <PIC> Before serving the chilled Thandai, stir it to make sure that the paste is not settled at the bottom (This usually happen if you chose to make thinner consistency drink). Pour in a glass garnish it with fresh or dried rose petals and chopped pistachios. Ohhh.. the creamy \u00a0texture, \u00a0the spice of pepper and that sweet aroma.\u00a0 Your Thandai is ready for that heavenly sip. :). Step 5: Experiments. \n          I like Thandai in its original form \u00a0the best , yet I did some experiments on my own and found them fun. Oh!! by the way the experiments also resulted in good taste.   Mix \u00a0a tea-spoon of instant coffee powder (I used Nescafe Gold) in Thandai to make your own chilled spiced latte. I love Pumpkin spiced latte of Starbucks, so this new taste was a delightful surprise.     If you are a chocolate lover, try to add some chocolate syrup (I tried Hershey's). Before I pour Thandai in a glass I lined the inside of glass with chocolate syrup (just the way they do it in Starbucks :]) and then gently poured Thandai in it.     Similarly you can use rose syrup :)     You can also sprinkle crushed peppers while serving to add more to spice.

Step 1: The Crust (Pate Brisee). <PIC> This recipe is for one double-crust 9\" pie. To get a flaky crust, the key is COLD. \u00a0I refrigerate all of my ingredients about 30 minutes prior. \u00a0At the very least, make sure the butter and water are both cold.\nIngredients:\n2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 tsp. salt\n2 Tbsp. granulated white sugar\n1 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into small pieces\n1/4 - 1/2 cup ice water\nCombine flour, sugar and salt in a food processor (or bowl, if that is what you have to work with). Add butter and pulse to combine until resembles course crumbs, about 10 to 15 seconds (if using bowl, cut the butter in with a pastry blender). Add ice water in a steady stream, starting with just 1/4 cup. Process just until the dough pinches together. If necessary add a little more water until you get to this state. You should not need more than 1/2 cup nor require longer than 30 seconds processing.\nTurn the dough out onto your work surface and divide in half. Shape into flattened discs, wrap each into plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. (The dough can be frozen for up to a month; thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using.)\nTake one disc and roll it out onto your floured work surface until about 12\" in diameter. Roll from the center out and rotate your crust quarter turns occasionally to avoid sticking. \u00a0Transfer the crust to a 9\" pie pan. \u00a0(To transfer, I gently fold the dough into quarters and unfold in the pan.) \u00a0Trim the edges, leaving about 1/2\" overhang and then fold them under. Cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.\nTake the second disc, and roll it out as above. Cut about 3 to 5 long, thin pieces from the middle. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet. Gently pinch each piece all along the length, and then roll so it is rope-like. Do not roll it very hard, as the idea is not lengthen the piece, just round it. Using a small flower-shaped cookie cutter, cut out and transfer about 7 flowers to the cookie sheet. With the remaining dough, use an almond-shaped cookie cutter to obtain as many pieces as you can. From the scraps, cut out small circles that will be the center of your flowers. For this last part, I didn't have anything just the size I wanted, so I roughly cut the circles and shaped them with my fingers. To finish off the leaves, use a knife or clean razor blade to lightly etch \"leaf lines\" into each almond-shaped dough piece. Cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.\nIn the meantime, continue on to the berry filling. Step 2: The Triple Berry Filling. <PIC> Ingredients:\n5 - 6 cups mixed berries (I used blackberries, blueberries and raspberries.)\n1/2 - 2/3 cup granulated white sugar (depending on your desired sweetness)\n1/4 cup tapioca starch OR corn starch\n1 tsp. ground cinnamon (I forgot to add this; still tastes great regardless)\nRinse and dry the berries. \u00a0Place them in a large mixing bowl, and stir in the remaining ingredients until uniformly coated. \u00a0Set aside.\n(Also pictured are the ingredients for the next step: \u00a01 egg, separated and heavy whipping cream.)  Step 3: Assembly & Baking. <PIC> Additional ingredients:\n1 egg, separated\n1 Tbsp. heavy whipping cream\nRemove the bottom crust from the refrigerator. \u00a0Use a pastry brush to apply a thin layer of egg white to the bottom. \u00a0This will help prevent it from getting soggy. \u00a0Pour the filling into the crust-lined pie pan, and use a spoon or spatula to get a roughly even surface with which to work.\nWhisk together the yolk and cream. \u00a0Brush a thin layer around the edge of the crust.\nRemove the crust flowers, vines and leaves from the refrigerator and let sit for a couple of minutes. \u00a0Start by putting down one long piece of rope-like dough across the top of the berry filling in a loopy, simple way (like an S shape). \u00a0Just make sure each end overlaps the bottom crust edges. \u00a0Lay down the other rope-like pieces as branch offs, keeping the design simple and loopy. \u00a0Cut down the lengths of the dough rope as it suits you. \u00a0Don't worry about bad branch connections or cracking/breaking pieces; you can always cover them up with leaves. \u00a0Once you are satisfied with the general vine shape, brush a thin layer of the yolk-cream mixture over it.\nAs you finish decorating from this point, apply the yolk-cream mixture on the tops of each piece as you go. \u00a0Use a little on the undersides of those that do not want to stay (especially the center of the flowers to their petals); it'll work like a paste.\nWherever you want to designate as the 'top' of your pie, that is where you will place a flower. \u00a0First place a leaf lightly down on either side. \u00a0Place a flower down between them, slightly covering the inner corners of the leaves. \u00a0Place several more leaves around the edge. \u00a0You will have to raise the previous leaf slightly and slide the new one under. \u00a0You can place as many around the edge as you want. \u00a0I did not go all the way around but left a few inches opposite the flower uncovered.\nPlace as many leaves as desired hanging off the vine branches. \u00a0You do not need to pinch these down; just gently place each where you want them. \u00a0Place your flowers where ever looks good to you. \u00a0Overlapping a leaf or two looks nice.\nPlace the pie in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.\nIn the meantime, preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.\nPlace the pie in the oven on top of a cookie sheet. \u00a0At about 10 to 15 minutes into baking, place an aluminum foil ring over the pie edges to prevent them from burning. \u00a0Continue baking for another \u00a035 to 40 minutes or until the top is golden brown.\nServe warm, at room temperature or cold. \u00a0Whipped cream or ice cream are excellent with it.\nEnjoy!", "images_list": ["triple-berry-pie-its-divine_0", "triple-berry-pie-its-divine_1", "triple-berry-pie-its-divine_2", "triple-berry-pie-its-divine_3"]}

It's one of his favourite movies so I thought I'd give it a try. I've never attempted a cake like this so here was my go at it.\nFor this cake you will need the following :\nparchment paper\nred, yellow, black and brown gel food colouring\nchocolate chips\nfondant (I used premade)\ncoconut\nrice krispy squares (also premade)\nicing\ntwo 16x24 cakes Step 1: . <PIC> I cut out a piece of parchment paper the size of my pan to draw the leg lamp shape and use as a guide for myself. I used about 12 premade rice krispy squares to mold and shape over my drawing to make sure I kept with proper proportions. My fear was that I would make one part too big or too long and then run out of space for the rest of the leg but as long and you place your sculpture over your reprence every so often you shouldn't run into this problem.\nOnce I was happy with my leg I covered it in a thin coat of cream cheese icing and put it in the fridge to set up. Step 2: . <PIC> I just bought white fondant and decided to dye it myself since I wasn't going to need very much of each colour. I used red and yellow food colouring mixed with the white fondant to create a flesh tone, I made a ball about the size of a tennis ball. I added black to just a tiny bit to get the shoe. Yellow in a ball about the same size as the leg. Last, I made several brown colours, all different to slightly miz together to give a wood grain effect for the \"wooden crate\" the lamp comes in.\nThe other thing I coloured was my coconut, I used it to mimic the straw that comes in the crate as packing material. I mixed yellow and brown food colouring in a bowl with some water and mixed it all around in the coconut. I then put it on a baking sheet and put it in the oven at the lowest setting and let it dry out. I think I left mine in for about 20 minutes and kept checking on it and stiring. It make take more or less time depending on how much water you used but our end goal is just to have the coconut dry again. Step 3: . <PIC> Now that the icing on the leg is nice and firm I rolled out my flesh coloured fondant and put it on. I then used melted chocolate chips and piped on the fishnet stockings, starting in one direction and then the other. i did this because if I waiting until the end of doing all my fondant and messed up on the fishnets then I would have to completely redo everything. I put the leg back in the fridge for the chocolate to harded then did the shoe and lamp shade.\nI stacked my two rectangle cakes and put the leg lamp on top with icing to secure it. Step 4: . <PIC> I took my rice krispy squares and coated them in icing and put them into the refridgerator. I then roughly mixed up my brown fondants and rolled them out. I used this brown fondant to cover the squares. Once they were all covered I stuck them around my cake and covered the exposed areas with coconut. Step 5: . <PIC> My final touches were making chocolate piping detail on the lamp shade and sticking in piped chocolate \"tassels\". I also had some extra icing and dyed it brown and piped it around the ouside of my cake to hide sopts where icing was peeking out from under the wood.\nYou're done! That's it, it's a lot easier than I thought it would be at first. ", "images_list": ["leg-lamp-cake_0", "leg-lamp-cake_1", "leg-lamp-cake_2", "leg-lamp-cake_3", "leg-lamp-cake_4", "leg-lamp-cake_5"]}

You can cook one of those monster 15 pounders, but it will take 15 hours or more.  \nA BBQ smoker\nA simple brisket spice rub\nYellow Mustard\nAn instant read thermometer\n3 cinderblocks and a grill grate (for starting charcoals)\ncharcoal (a few matchlight type or lighter fluid, and regular charcoal)\nTime to maintain your smoker at correct temperature for at least an hour per pound of brisket\nNote: I should explain that in several of the pictures there is a brisket at the top of the frame, and 2 pork spareribs at the bottom of the frame.  Because I was cooking a small brisket (that I wanted) there was room on the smoker for ribs (which my wife wanted) Step 1: The Spice Rub. <PIC> On a brisket, there are 2 layers of fat.  One runs through the center of the brisket, and the other covers the top.  You will need to trim the top cover of fat to about a 1/4 inch.  Put a light coat of yellow mustard all over your brisket and coat with the spice rub.  Just coat it, don't rub it.  Everything else I smoke is left overnight with a spice rub.  Brisket takes on flavor quicker than pork or poultry.  Take it out of the refrigerator, trim, add spice and let it sit at room temperature for an hour while you set up your smoker.\nHere is a simple Brisket rub:\n3/4 Cup Kosher salt\n1/2 Cup Garlic powder\n1/2 Cup Onion powder\n1/2 Cup Italian Seasoning\nThis is way more rub than you need for this recipe.  Put it in a jar, mark it put the rest away.\nDON'T PUT SUGAR IN THIS ONE!  The brisket I'm doing for the instructable here is only about 4 pounds.  I usually do an 8 lb brisket and so it is on the smoker for at least 8 hours.  Sugar will turn into an almost hard candy shell over your brisket.  Pepper burns and turns bitter when you cook it that long.\nPut a light coat of yellow mustard Put the brisket on fat side up.  You won't be moving it for the duration of cooking.\nNote:  the meat you see below the brisket are ribs.  I did both together as they cook at the same temperature and the same time because this is only a 4 Lb brisket.   Step 2: Heat Management. <PIC> Beef Brisket is probably the most difficult BBQ you will do.  I say difficult but follow a few secrets, and you can turn brisket out like a pro.\nThese are the secrets to good BBQ Brisket.\n1) Keep the heat at 220 degrees( F).  You can go up to 225 degrees while you make adjustments, but you should be cooking at 220 (F).  For you lucky people out there with top and bottom vents on your smokers this control is pretty easy.  After you load the charcoals in to the fire box, the bottom vent regulates how hot the coals will burn.  A wide open bottom vent will make the smoker hot.  Shut down the air to the coals and the smoker cools down.  The top vent controls how much smoke flows over the food.  Wide open, a lot of smoke.  Almost closed, a little smoke.\n2) To be tender, the finished brisket should be at 190 degrees.  The time it takes to get there can vary according to variables such as outside temperature, your smoker,  rain, wind, etc.  It will take at least an hour per pound, so start your checks at that point.  It can take as long as an hour and a half per pound.  Don't get discurraged, it will be awsome when it does hit.  \nIf you don't have an instant read thermometer, you should get one.  They don't cost a lot and you can be sure when your meat is \"spot on\". Step 3: Charcoal Brickettes. <PIC> Initially, I load my smoker up with 32 brickettes.  To start the coals, I usually put 4 \"matchlight\" type brickettes in the bottom of each hole in the cynderblock with a paper fuse, fill the balance of the holes with regular charcoal and light them up.  This week I didn't have ant \"Matchlight\", so put 4 regular charcoals in the bottom and added a little lighter fluid to them and continued as normal.  I like the assurance that the coals will light, but not the taste of fluid, so this lets me add a minimum of fluid.\nMake sure you have water in the water pan.  Because I don't have adjustment vents on my smoker, it helps keep the smoker at a low temperature. \nYou will have to add about 16 new brikettes (already white ashed) to the fire box every hour, so you need to start them about 15-20 minutes ahead of time.  Every hour when you replenish the charcoal, check the water pan to see if you need to add more.  Do not let the waterpan go dry or the temperature will soar.  \nYou will have to keep this up for at least an hour per pound of brisket, so think twice before buying the 15 lb monster.  It's better to buy (2) 8 pounders. Step 4: A Finished Brisket. <PIC> I had what I feel was ideal BBQ conditions this weekend.  It was in the low 80's, with a gentle breeze.  \nTo my surprise my 4 pound Brisket was done in 4 hours.  190 degrees.  I put the brisket in a bowl and tightly covered the bowl with aluminum foil to rest for 20 minutes before slicing.\nIt came out perfectly.  Juicey and full of flavor.\nHere is a slicing tip.  When you are going to slice, turn it fat side down and cut across the grain.  The knife with start better and your slices more uniform.  I did have a picture of the sliced brisket but it didn't save.  (Murphy's law)\nEven my friends who like BBQ sauce eat this as is.

I wanted to make tasty muffins with them so I made these beauties!One muffin really fills you up with deliciousness & goodness for your body! They aren\u2019t that sweet either. I also made them vegan! ;) Yeah! :)  They are great as a lovely breakfast on the go, or when you sit down with a good vegan caf\u00e9 latte. I enjoy them with some vegan butter! :)These also make an excellent food gift, just see for yourself! :)Recipe: For 15 larger flower-shaped muffinsIngredients: * The dry ingredients: 2 cups of buckwheat flour 1 cup of brown rice flour 1 cup of gluten-free rolled oats 1 large juicy apple, peeled, cored & cut up into smaller chunks 1 tablespoon + 1/2 tablespoon gluten-free baking powder 1/2 teaspoon finely grinned Maldon sea salt, in a pestle & mortar 2/3 cup  coconut sugar 3 tablespoons grinned flaxseed/ I ground broken flaxseed in my dry container of my Vitamix on full-speed until it resembles a flour. Measure 3 tablespoons. * The wet ingredients: 2/3 cup water 1/2 cup canola oil 1 cup + 1/2 cup unsweetened soy milk Method:1. Preheat your fan oven to 200\u00b0C ( 400 F ) for about 10 minutes. If you don\u2019t use a fan oven, change it. 2. Take a larger bowl & place a sieve over it. Sieve your 2 flours. Remove sieve. Add baking powder, sugar, sea salt, GF oats & coconut sugar. With a spoon mix it gently, to keep the air in. Finally, add the chopped apple pieces through it. 3. In a smaller bowl, add 3 tablespoons flaxseed powder. Add water. Whisk away & let it sit on your kitchen counter for about 5-10 minutes or until it forms kind of a gel. The mass will become thicker.This is instead of eggs, works as a binder.  Now, add canola oil & unsweetened soy milk & whisk until fully joined. Now, add wet ingredients to the bowl with dry ingredients & mix it just gently through, just until it is all gently mixed in because you don\u2019t want the air to be gone! ;) I use silicon flower mats so I don\u2019t have to grease them. With the help of a larger spoon, spoon your muffin mix for 3/4 into the flower muffin mat. I have larger flower muffin shapes then the normal muffins so you will end up with huger flower-shaped muffins!  I could fill 15 flower-shaped muffins. I place them on a Silpat on an oven rack for stability. Place them in the lower side of your oven & bake for about 20 minutes until a test pin comes out clean. Leave the muffins in their silicon casings for about 10 minutes. This way, your muffins will get a lovely shine on them & they are easily to remove. After these 10 minutes, carefully flip them over & out of the mats & place on a cooling rack to cool down or savor them still a bit warm with some vegan butter & a vegan caf\u00e9 latte! They are very delicious! :) MMM,\u2026 Excellent with vegan butter! :)You can find this recipe also here: http://sophiesfoodiefiles.wordpress.com/2014/08/09/gluten-free-vegan-buckwheat-oat-apple-muffins/ Step 1: .

It is easy to make and only requires 4 ingredients. It doesn\u2019t contain any yeast or baking soda. I use a kitchen machine to knead the dough but you can do it by hand as well.You can eat flatbread with for example a (spicy) curry or stew The flatbread remains nice and soft. You can eat it directly, keep in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or freeze them and use when needed. Step 1: Overview. <PIC> To make the flatbread, you start with 300 grams of all purpose flour and add \u00bd teaspoon of salt in a bowl or the kitchen machine. Then take 175 ml of unsweetened almond milk  (if you are non vegan you can use regular milk) and put it on the stove  and add 50 grams of vegan butter. Warm slowly to dissolve the butter (do not boil the milk). As soon as the butter is dissolved take the milk  from the heat.Add the milk mixture to the flour. Turn on your kitchen machine or knead it through by hand until you have an elastic dough. In the kitchen  machine this takes about 2 to 3 minutes by hand this will take more like 10 minutes. Take the dough out of the kitchen machine and flour your  board to knead the dough through by hand. Wrap in foil and let it rest  for about 30 to 40 at room temperature. The gluten in the dough are now  activated. After an ample rest period take the dough out of the foil and knead the dough with some flour. Then slice the dough into 6 pieces to get  medium sized (8 inch) flatbread or 4 pieces for large (10 inch) flatbread or 10  pieces for small (6 inch) flatbread. Flour the board and roll the flatbread into a round shape, be aware not too thin. I love to cook with a cast iron skillet and recommend anyone to get one and heat it on medium to high heat. Use some vegetable or olive oil and  brush your skillet. Bake the flatbread until you see brown patches and  bubbles on the flatbread. Bake for 2 minutes and turn the flatbread to  bake for another 2 minutes. Then the flatbread is done. You can brush  some oil and finely chopped garlic to turn it into garlic flatbread. Step 2: Watch the One Minute Video. Want to see how to make the flavorsome soft vegan flatbread? Watch the 1-minute food inspiration video. Step 3: What Do You Need to Make This Recipe. <PIC> 2 cups / 300 gram of plain flour (plus some additional flour to flour the board for rolling the dough)\u00bd teaspoon of salt.50 grams of vegan /vegetable butter.175 ml of unsweetened almond milk.Vegetable oil for backing. Step 4: Instructions. <PIC> Put flour and salt in the kitchen machine.Melt butter and combine with milk.Add the milk mixture to the flour and salt.Let kitchen machine run to combine into an elastic dough.Knead the dough by hand for a couple of minutes.Wrap in foil and let it rest for at least 30-40 minutes.Knead the dough on a floured board before cutting into 6 equal pieces.Roll with a rolling pin into tortilla shaped circles of about 8 inch. Do not roll to thin.Heat a skillet with some sunflower oil or olive oil.Bake the flatbread about 2  minutes per side. The flatbread should get brown patches and you will  see bubbles appear. Turn and bake the other side.Ready to serve. Step 5: Notes. <PIC> You can eat the flatbread with for example a nice vegetable curry or stew.You can store the flatbread temporarily in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or freeze them and use when needed.I hope you enjoy this recipe!

With very few ingredients they're fairly easy to make, just requiring a bit of time and muscle.\nThey can be made with whichever seeds you prefer, though my favourite is cumin, and served with whatever dip you have lurking in the fridge. Step 1: Ingredients and Equipment. <PIC> \n          For this example I was using cumin seeds, but treat any seeds you use in the same way. If they are on the larger side, like coriander seeds, grind them down a bit after toasting or the dough will tear when you try and roll it out.Ingredients:\n\t\t275 g plain flour\n\t\t60 g vegetable shortening\n\t\t1 1/2 tbsp seeds (cumin, coriander or fennel are all good choices)\n\t\t1 tsp baking powder\n\t\t1/2 tsp salt\n\t\t1 cup waterEquipment:\n\t\tLarge mixing bowl\n\t\tMeasuring cups/scales\n\t\tMeasuring spoons\n\t\tClingfilm\n\t\tSmall sharp knife (a pizza wheel would also come in handy)\n\t\tRolling Pin\n\t\tBaking parchment\n\t\tBaking trays\n\t\tOven heated to 200 C/400 F/Gas 6\nFor anyone without scales, a good weight to volume conversion guide can be found here.\n         Step 2: Prep. <PIC> First toast the seeds to release the flavour. Do this by putting them in a small saucepan over a low heat for a few minutes, stirring frequently. You should be able to smell when they are toasted. Leave to cool.\nMeasure the flour, baking powder and salt into the mixing bowl. Add the seeds and mix it all together. Cut the shortening into small cubes and add it to the flour mix. Step 3: Making the Dough. <PIC> Rub the fat into the flour with your fingertips until it is all combined, and the mixture looks like breadcrumbs.\nNow add the water. You might not need the whole cup, so add it slowly, in small doses. As you add the water, mix it into the flour to make a fairly stiff dough. You can use a flat bladed knife to combine the dough, or just use your hands if you don't mind getting a bit messy.\nOnce the dough has come together, turn it onto a lightly floured surface and knead it briefly. Do this for a few minutes, until the dough is fairly smooth. (This is a good website to demonstrate kneading technique, if you are haven't worked with dough much)\nWrap the dough in clingfilm and leave it in the fridge for at least half an hour to rest. Step 4: Rolling Out. <PIC> The key to moreish crunchy crackers is to roll the dough out as thinly as possible. (I have a suspicion that a pasta machine might make this job a whole lot easier, but until then I have to rely on the strength of my muscles.)\nTake the dough out of the fridge and cut off about a third, put the rest back in the fridge.\nRoll the dough out as thin as you can get it. I find the simplest way to do this is to roll it out straight onto the baking parchment, just keep going, rolling out from the middle. Once you have a thin layer covering the parchment, trim off the edges to make a rectangle of dough and move the parchment onto your baking tray.\nUse a sharp knife or pizza cutter to mark out the dough into crackers. You can make these any shape you want, but I usually keep it simple and cut it into small rectangles. Step 5: Bake & Finish. <PIC> Bake the crackers for about 7-10 minutes, until golden and crunchy. Watch them carefully, they can go from golden to burnt very quickly.\nTip onto a cooling rack or into a bowl to cool off. Re-roll the scraps into the remaining dough, and cut off another chunk to roll out. Roll, cut and bake until you've used all the dough, or until you get bored (this makes a lot of crackers!). The raw dough will keep in the fridge for a couple of days, if you prefer to bake it off in batches.\nServe with your choice of dips. I use hummus or a goo chutney with cumin seed crackers, while fennel works well with a cream cheese spread.\nKeep the crackers in a airtight container. They should have a fairly long shelf life, but I can only reliably guarantee them for a few days, since that's all the time they last around my flatmates.", "images_list": ["simple-seeded-crackers_0", "simple-seeded-crackers_1", "simple-seeded-crackers_2", "simple-seeded-crackers_3", "simple-seeded-crackers_4", "simple-seeded-crackers_5"]}

Air has 25.93 g/mol. Result of this is when you have CO2 in bottle, it won't mix with air until wind blows into the bottle (at least for some time, due to diffusion). Step 1: Materials. <PIC> OK, now what will we need: Step 2: Making the Base. <PIC> First, take the sand paper.\nIf the cap has some imprint on it, sand it down so the cap is flat.\nIn the middle of the cap, use the sand paper and make it rough. It should not be smooth.\nNow we will drill three holes so that an M3 screw can be put in them.\nOne will be in middle and the other on opposite sides, place them near the inner cap circle.\nNow, rip off anything overlapping off the holes. Step 3: Placing Screws. <PIC> Now, put M3 screws in the outter holes with head down.\nFrom top, put pads on them and then nuts.\nTighten until screws get \u00a0partially inside the plastic (this will deform the plastic a bit).\nThis will ensure they will be air-tight.\nLook at photos. Step 4: Making Spring Holder and Placing Spring. <PIC> Now, cut a piece of metal. The shape of it is up to you, but rectangle is easiest.\nIts length should be about the same as cap's diameter.\nMake it wide enough so it won't break when you make 3 holes into it.\nUse rasp to make edges and corners round (for safety).\nNow drill into it 2 holes of M3 size in the same distance as the screws are placed in cap.\nBetween them, make another hole. Its size will vary, because you need to use screw big enough to hold the spring.\nNow, put a short screw in the middle hole.\nPut pad and nut into the spring and screw it together with spring holder.\nYou can see it on photos.\nNow just put the spring holder on screws and put nuts on them. Step 5: Making the \"valve\". <PIC> Now, cut a rectangle out of rubber. It should be some rubber that doesn't bend very easily.\nI used pipe sealing rubber.\nIts width should be bigger than diameter of hole in cap.\nMake it longer than its width.\nPut some oil on the top of cap around the hole.\nIt should be some light oil with no smell, non-toxic. I would like to suggest you to use silicone oil.\n(It is often sold as spray, very good for this use)\nPut also a bit on the bottom of rubber.\nPut the rubber between the hole and spring. It should cover the hole and spring should be applying some force onto it.\nUse the nuts on screws to adjust the pressing force of spring.\nIt might be good to use some anti-corrosive or at least any protective paint on heads of the screws.\nThe rest which will not be inside the bottle doesn't need any paint, the silicone oil will be enough.Good luck in brewing!", "images_list": ["poor-mans-airlock_0", "poor-mans-airlock_1", "poor-mans-airlock_2", "poor-mans-airlock_3", "poor-mans-airlock_4", "poor-mans-airlock_5"]}

My kids love faux-foods, and this one we came up with on our own.\nStrawberry flavored marshmallow Rice Krispie treats with dried blueberry \"seeds\" covered with fondant. Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> I used the standard Rice Krispie Ceral Treat recipe. I had to double it to make mini watermelon. So buy 1 large box of cereal and 2 bags of strawberry marshmallows.\nYou still need to make in two separate batches to make it easier to handle.\nWatermelon Filling\n3 Tablespoons of butter\n6 Cups of Rice Krispie Treat Cereal\n1 10 oz. bag of Kraft Jet-Puffed Strawberry Marshmallows\n1/4 Cup of dried blueberries\nWatermelon Skin\n8 oz of mini marshmallows (half a bag)\n1 pound of powdered sugar\nwater\nshortening (for your hands) Step 2: Watermelon Skin. <PIC> \nThe skin of the watermelon is made from fondant. Do not use pre-made fondant from a bucket. Make you own. The recipe I used is from Peggy Weaver's site.http://whatscookingamerica.net/PegW/Fondant.htm\nJust follow the directions on her site. It is the best tasting fondant and is easy to make. Once you have the base fondant made start adding color. I started with equal parts green and yellow. Add just a few drops at a time and work it in. Once you have a good yellowish-green put a third of it in a plastic bag. Now start darkening the remain 2/3 with more green and some blue. Again work in the colors a few drops at a time before adding more. If your green is too bright add a drop of red. Compare to you light green to judge your colors. Put the darker green in a baggie and place them in the refrigerator. Step 3: Watermelon Insides. <PIC> Clean up from the previous step. I made my treats using the microwave. I first melted three tablespoons of butter. Then add one bag of StrawberryMallows and coat with butter. I heated them in 30 second increments. Stir in between each heating. After a minute most of them should be melted, if not continue to mix. There should be enough heat to melt the rest.\nI added about 5 drops of red food coloring, I wanted the inside to be a little more pink. Now add 6 cups of Rice Krispie Cereal. Stir them in with the dried blueberries. (Our first thought was to use chocolate chips, but they would have melted too easily.)\nSpread the mixture on to a greased cookie sheet to let it cool. Now repeat the recipe again and add the second batch on top of the first.\nWhen it has cooled enough to handle, roll it up into a log and cover with waxed paper. It needs to cool for an hour or longer. If it is too warm it will loose it's shape. Step 4: Forming the Melon. <PIC> Use your hands and starting shaping in to melon. My wife thought it looked like raw hamburger and my daughter thought it looked like a brain. If it holds it shape then your are ready for the fondant. If it starts to sag, let it dry out some more.\nGet the fondant it out and knead it some. It will warm up quickly. Use powdered sugar to keep it from sticking to the counter and rolling pin.\nI used a piece of plastic wrap to get the size I need to roll out. Make sure your stripes are in the right direction. Step 5: Finshing Touches. <PIC> Wrap the Rice Krispie shape up in the fondant and work out and seams. You can add more stripes over the green and just smooth them in. If it is getting sticky add a little powdered sugar and rub it in.\nIf you have it outside slice it quick, the humidity make the \"skin\" stick together.

Bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes and leave it in the oven until it cools down to room temperature.  You will notice as it bakes, it will expand a bit.  Also, the top part cracked but it's fine since it going to be covered with toppings. Step 3: White Chocolate Bones. <PIC> Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler.On a parchment, take a spoonful and make a vertical line, then take another spoonful and add 2 round shapes on each end.  Let this cool in the refrigerator until it hardens.Decorate the top part with red writing icing. Step 4: Chocolate Whipped Cream. <PIC> In a sauce pan in moderate heat, place the sugar and half of the cream.  When the sugar dissolves, place the cream in a bowl with the dark chocolate and stir until melted.When it is completely cooled down, add in the rest of the cream and whisk until it's thick and fluffy. Step 5: Assembly. <PIC> Decorate the pavlova with writing icing.  Pipe 2 yellow half arches for the eyeballs. Outline the eyes with black icing and place 2 dots for the pupils.  Make another outline with green icing around the eyes and a horizontal line for the brow.  Place the chocolate cream on top of the pavlova.Arrange the raspberries on top and the chocolate bones.Have a slice and enjoy your fruits of labor.

{"id": "RECIPE_853", "question": "What are the essential steps to craft a delightful Liquid Apple Pie drink that captures the essence of apple pie?", "provenance": [40556], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Liquid Apple Pie (xxx). <PIC> I first heard about this drink on a TV show I like \"Justified\", it intrigued me enough to look it up online. Incidentally, this recipe barely resembles the drink from the show as moonshiners just mix their moonshine 50/50 with apple juice. Anyway, there are a litany of recipes for the drink all over online, but this is a blending of multiple recipes and of course plenty of trial and error, even though my 1st batch was perhaps the best I've ever made.The name \"Apple Pie\" hits the nail on the head as each drink tastes exactly like a bite of apple pie. Even better, this drink has enough booze to warm you up during the cold nights of the Holidays I make it for, especially Thanksgiving and Christmas. But perhaps most surprising is even with the considerable amount of grain alcohol (essentially legal moonshine) in this recipe you can barely tell there is any alcohol in it at all as long as you let it age a little. The taste right after you make it barely resembles the finished taste after a week of aging.I promise any holiday gathering you serve this at or bring to will make you the toast of the party. I give small mason jars of this for Christmas gifts. I rarely get very much of it because as soon as word is out I have a batch, you would think I won the lotto with all the friends and family who come out of the woodwork.Fair warning in advance, this isn't something you make on a whim. The amount of time it takes to make and age relegates it to special occasions rather than random cravings.  Step 1: Gather Ingredients. <PIC> 1 Gallon Apple Cider*If you notice in the picture, the cider I used was lightly colored and cloudy, as a result the finished product wasn't as pretty as usual. *Keep in mind that some cider's have more sediment than others, if you get a sediment heavy variety, you might want to strain the finished product through cheese cloth.1 Gallon Apple Juice4 Cups Granulated Sugar(Haven't tried raw sugar, but have high hopes for it)1 Tbs. Vanilla Extract6-10 Cinnamon Sticks1 750 ml Bottle Everclear (180 proof grain alcohol)*White Rum +50% volume can be substituted*But Everclear gives better results and it takes less1 Apple(Optional) Step 2: Combine 1st Set of Ingredients. <PIC> Turn stove to setting 8 out of 10In large stockpot combine:Apple JuiceKeep Empty Jug for laterApple CiderKeep Empty Jug for laterVanilla ExtractCinnamon Sticks (6 of them)Sugar(Wait until the mixture is steaming to add the sugar. Add the sugar slowly while stirring)You should still haveLiquor6 of the cinnamon sticks*This is mostly decoration, but also increases the cinnamon profile slightly1 apple (optional)*This is strictly decoration to have in the serving container, especially if it is see through, I personally don't like to include it, but my mom does Step 3: Heating. <PIC> Keep stockpot uncovered Adjust heat if necessaryEssentially you want steaming and almost a low rolling boil, you shouldn't see bubbles forming and rushing up from bottom of pot, but you should see the liquid rolling at the surface making it look semi-turbulentThe length of time to leave on the stove is largely choiceAt minimum, heat until the cinnamon sticks unroll most of the wayThe longer you heat, the more volume you lose and the richer the flavor I recommend 4-6 hrs.  Step 4: Cooling. Remove stockpot from heatLeave it in the stockpot, separating it out into the storage containers at this point will cause problems(You would not believe the blooper reel I could put together)Separating into various containers will come later Let stand until the product reaches room temperatureMoving on to the next step while the product is still hot will result in evaporation of the alcohol(Once I moved on to the next step while product was still being heated on stove, and another time right after I took it off the stove, this is a bigger problem than you would think since you can't add alcohol to taste, as aging is critical, so any change in alcohol content will result in you waiting the entire aging time without knowing if it is too strong or too weak.)Remove the used cinnamon sticks from the pot Step 5: Add Liquor . <PIC> With the product cooled to at least room temperature (cooler is better)Pour the liquor into the mixture slowlyHave grain alcohol splash into your eye, and you will appreciate the slowly part of this step Step 6: Bottle for Aging. <PIC> Regardless of how you intend on serving it, the two best choices for bottling during the aging processPour into 2 gallon jugsBecause of all the volume loss from the heating stage, the entire concoction, even with the booze added should fit back into the two gallon jugs left over from the Apple Juice and Apple Cider if you so choose.Pour into smaller bottlesI have used old small liquor bottles I had keptGood option for gift giving, just throw a bow on itThis facilitates your rationing so you don't run out unexpectedlyApple cider often has sediment in it, add in the sediment that can come off of the cinnamon sticks and you can have a significant amount of foreign material left at the bottom of your containers. This can be off putting to some so if you like, you can put cheese cloth in the funnel when bottling the product to get rid of it.*This is the only time I have tried this and while it is a pain in the backside, it filtered it out exceptionally wellAdd cinnamon sticks to the bottles whether they are the final product, or just being used for the aging processLet set undisturbed for at least 5 days, although I consider a week the minimum.The product must remain cool during aging and storage thereafter.The longer you leave it to age the better the flavor up to 10 days, at that point aging will no longer change the product.The longer you leave it to age the less you notice the presence of alcohol up to 10 days, at that point the drink is what it is.I wish I could tell you how long the shelf life it, but it never lasts long, even when I manage not to suck it all down, as soon as the word gets out I have a batch, friends and family suddenly flood through doors and windows, so the longest I have ever stored it was one of the bottles I gave as a present that was stored for 3 weeks after I let it age a little more than 1 week. So I can guarantee that it is safe and good for at least 4 weeks as long as you keep it coldSince this drink is most popular during the colder months, depending on where you live you could get away with storing it in the garage. If not, the fridge is your only choice Step 7: Serving. As discussed earlier, it can be given in small bottles as gifts and of course can be consumed directly from the bottle, even with the cinnamon stick still in it. Or a similar way that has gotten a much better response is to put in small mason jars with decorative fabric over the lid, under the ring, with a ribbon glued around the ring, of course each jar has its own cinnamon stickWhen we are hosting parties, we have a large glass jug in the shape of an apple with a spout at the bottom. When serving this way, of course add cinnamon sticks, but if you choose you can include apple wedges as well for decoration. I prefer the flavor better when served cold, even in the cold weather the drink warms you up all on its own, some prefer it room temp and some prefer it warmed slightly, decide for yourself.When done properly, even with the large amount of grain alcohol, more than a few people have had no idea that it contained alcohol. But it is in there, so be careful, it is stronger than the average cocktail.My favorite holidays to make this for are Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas/Christmas Eve, New Years and the only warm weather holiday, the 4th of July(after all, what's more American than Apple Pie? especially with booze in it)", "images_list": ["liquid-apple-pie-xxx_0", "liquid-apple-pie-xxx_1", "liquid-apple-pie-xxx_2", "liquid-apple-pie-xxx_3", "liquid-apple-pie-xxx_5", "liquid-apple-pie-xxx_6"]}

This cake was made for my pal Sydney for her 40th. Her nickname is Squidney and her favorite flowers are wildflowers, so I used flowers to represent where she's from: California poppies and billy balls and Texas yellow roses mixed in with wild roses, lily leaves, ivy and filler flowers.We're going to focus on how to make edible flora and aquatic fauna from gum paste.Gum paste (sugar paste) is like adult play doh. It has incredible capacity for fine detailing much like sculpey. You can roll it out paper thin and tool it with fine detail in a way you can not with chocolate or fondant. You can create life like objects with gum paste.  Look at how crazy this guy is!  Soooo good! Look how good you can get if this was you job!Making a lot of flowers takes time as you make each petal individually. It's a rather meditative practice. the cake pictured here took about 6 hours in sculpting time.Gum paste is more brittle than fondant when it dries. It is not delicious to eat, so I don't even bother making it from scratch, although it is easy to make. Gum paste dries fast and hard, so you have to know what you are doing but it also is not difficult to sculpt with. This is actually an ok first project to learn with, since you use a variety of different methods to make flowers and it takes very little practiced skill. You do not need to make the exact flowers I make. Use what tools you have on hand, the techniques are similar for a wide variety of decor. A lily is very similar to an orchid or poppy in how it is constructed. You can guesstimate how to make any flower after you see how the techniques work.For this gum paste tutorial you need specialized tools but you can fudge it ok with some kitchen items:a bucket of gum paste. I get a pound of Satin Ice brand paste. It seems to last forever if wrapped up tight. corn starch (powdered sugar works too) shortening modeling tools: ball rollers,  (you can use a kit like Wilton or clay modeling tools dedicated to kitchen use. I had an old wilton kit with the plastic green tools. The nicer end ones are made of metal. They all work very similarly.) thin foams for rolling out petals food safe floral wire, tape and stamen assortment toothpicks cookie cutter shapes for petals and leaves plastic leaf veining form for leaves flower punch molder rolling pin egg carton or very small bowls (I used some spoons too) to let the flowers dry in a supported cup shape gel coloring pastes (not liquid color)Here are some tips for working with gum paste:work with small amounts because it dries out fast. I keep small bits rolled up in balls under a glass. I also store petals and leaves under a glass until it is time to detail them. rub shortening on gum paste if it dries out. Coat it with small bit of corn starch if it is too greasy, if hand mixing darker colors, use gloves. don't rush. Make these weeks in advance. It is better this way as they need to dry out sometimes for a week anyway to stiffen up and if you are a beginner very often after the drying period bits with crack and fall off and you might need to make more. try to make more items than you need as delicate flowers are fragile. You will have unsuccessful flowers. I have about a 10% throw away rate with this batch. Step 1: Gum Paste Wild Roses. <PIC> With a toothpick, tint a tiny thumb size bit of gum paste a pale yellow color. I use gel coloring paste so that it doe not affect the rigidity of the gum paste. 1. Roll small balls of yellow gum paste  in your palms, paying attention to smoothness. cut your stamen to under half an inch and stick them in the balls. I used around 7 stamens for each ball.Each wild rose will have five petals. Make an extra petal  for each rose so you can select the best one.2. To make petals, roll out your gum paste from the center to the edges to under 1/8 inch thick and use a petal shaped cutter to punch out your petals. There are two kinds of foams we will use for these flowers. The purple one is similar to kid's craft foam, dense and gives very little for applying pressure. we use this to thin out the petal. The pink foam is less dense and has a lot of give and is ideal for rippling the edges for a realistic petal appearance. 3. Place each petal on the harder purple gum paste foam first and roll it out with a ball modeler. Press in the middle first and roll it to wards the edges in a moon shape. You are trying to indent a petal shape very similar to the curvature of your own cupped palm.  I leave a little extra gum paste around the edges so I can have more to work with for the next step.4. On the pink foam, use the same ball roller to press out the edges to create a rippled effect.5. Make a finger's amount of dusty green gum paste. Roll it out and punch out a few calyx shapes.I used spoons to create a cupping supportive shape for the roses to dry on. You could use small bowls or egg crates. I like having a little variety in the slope. the larger your vessel the more open your flower will be.6. While your petals sit  for a few minutes, mix up gum paste glue. This is just pinching off a tiny bit of the gum paste and stirring water. My ratio is about a thumb nail ball of gum paste to a 1/4 cup of warm water. 7. Place the green calyx on the measuring spoon or cup. Wit ha small paint brush dab the center with your glue. add each white petal on one by one, overlapping just slightly every time you add a petal. Use the glue on the areas where the petals overlap. Brush on more glue in the center and lightly press your yellow ball in the center.8. Hope for the best. 9. Get floral wire and make a little hook on the end. Burn it on the stove so it is hot. press it into the bottom of your flower so it melts through and \"hooks\" in the thickest part. the gum paste should melt around it forming a permanent tomb for the wire.These took two days to dry because the center of the balls take a little bit. if a petal falls off use one of your spares to glue a fresh one back on. Step 2: Gum Paste Tentacles. <PIC> Oh my god this was monotonous to do. Look. I'm NOT a zen person. I can not really meditate. All that chat about meditating before is a big lie. I can't yoga. I  just can't. If you are all namaste about stuff, this is gonna work out great for you. If not, just make a floral cake. No one will judge you. Tentacles are cool to look at though, and without them this cake would be a boring normal floral cake. I guess I lied about judging. Make the tentacles! You can do it!1.Mix up a fist and a half of fondant to a weird sickly squid color. You'll probably want to mix some red with brown and purple or blue. Mix a half a fist of gum paste to a weird underwater squid purple color these are for the suction cups.2.Roll out various sizes of squid tentacles using your pal. this is similar to making your average play doh snake shape. Taper one side, and using the side of your finger make an indentation right through the middle of the tentacle.Curl them in different shapes to evoke cephalopod movements.3.Roll out hundreds upon hundreds of tiny little purple balls.We're talking small like the size of a peppercorn. Hundreds. So many hundreds of these....4. Brush some glue on the tentacle. Using the modeling tool that is shaped like a \"nub,\" press each tentacle into the tentacle indentation. Parallel zippering looks most natural. Dry these out for a couple of days. when you finally place them on your cake you'll find that  some look better flat and some can add a lot of drama and dimension when placed vertically. Step 3: Gum Paste Flowers and Leaves. <PIC> Make more! Tons more.Ivy leaves and other leaves can be cut out with cookie cutter shapes and used as is or with a little floral wire . To attach floral wire to thin pieces jsut use a little extra pinch of gum paste on the back.roses can be made by rolling a ball around floral wire in a teardrop shape and attaching individual shaped petals one it one by one.Poppies were made just like the wild rose but I rolled the style in actual poppy seeds. Yup! Pretty cool. I also mixed a little gel dye and water up to brush on the petals to add color variation. I let some dry out in jar lids and some in measuring cups to have variance in bloom shapes.The small blue and white flowers were made by pressing gum paste in a typical wilton flower mold and popping a hooked wire in the center. these were made into bunches using floral tape. be sure to used food safe floral tape. The daisies were made with a daisy shape cutter and the centers were made with a style mold.The billy balls are rolled into balls and rolled over a bumpy plastic texturizer to create the feel of pollen. These balls were also hooked on to heated floral wire and were dried upside down on my dish rack.To create floral texture for large leaves, you cut the leaves out first then press them against the veining molds before you shape them very gently on the foams. If you want them on floral wire, you can stick the floral wires directly into balls of gum paste and roll it out after, in order to have a very stable leaf on a wire that is thin. use up your gum paste completely by making spirals and x-tra decorative elements. Step 4: Bake, Fill and Ice a Cake. <PIC> For this cake, I baked two vanilla pound cakes with orange, lemon and lime zest. I cut the cakes in half and lopped off their puffy tops for nice flat layering.The icing  was a standard vanilla buttercream, but I scraped some fresh vanilla bean in.The strawberry filling was out of control however- salted caramel balsamic strawberry filling which I made up completely.two pounds of strawberriesone cup of sugarvery fancy balsamic vinegarrest of the scraped vanilla podsaltapricot jamI a saucepan melt you sugar down into a syrup and watch for ait to turn a medium gold caramel. Add half you strawberries in and simmer until it reduces into sexy jam. This took a good twenty minutes.  Fold the rest of your sliced fresh  strawberries into the hot jam and add a couple of spoons of apricot jam. Douse with a heavy pour of balsamic and a tablespoon of salt.To ice your cake it is best to pipe a thick circle of frosting to act as a barrier for  your strawberries which are going to leak into your cake.Layer it up and frost the outside with an offset spatula. I always frost a thin crumb coat on first and refrigerate the cake for 15 mins before doing an other layer, but since we are covering this in fondant it is not as important.  Step 5: Decorate Cake. <PIC> Cover your cake in fondant.Do not use gum paste. fondant is soft and pliable. I usually serve my cakes by peeling the fondant off first unless someone is into eating it for some reason. fondant is not just a decorative element. it keeps your cakes study and moist and it is so great when you are transporting a cake and it has to sit around before cutting.Stick all your decor on the cake. You will want to use your glue for the flat pieces but in some cases it might be best to use a little butter cream icing. A lot of the flowers and leaves are not able to sit flush on the curved surface of the cake. icing helps that.Surprisingly, I had used the leftover bits of gum paste to shape small spirals and curly wiggle shapes. These were very useful in adding dimension and filling up empty space.So pretty! Much oooh. Much Aaaaah.", "images_list": ["floral-tentacle-cake_0", "floral-tentacle-cake_1", "floral-tentacle-cake_2", "floral-tentacle-cake_3", "floral-tentacle-cake_4", "floral-tentacle-cake_5"]}

{"id": "RECIPE_878", "question": "What are the essential steps to create a delightful Hippo-Bubblepizza that stands out from traditional pizza?", "provenance": [40572], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Hippo-Bubblepizza. <PIC> Greetings dear Readers!Hereby I present to you the Hippo-Bubblepizza!We all know Pizza, I guess. Normally it's a flat disk of bread covered with tomato-sauce and topped with cheese and some other ingredients to your liking.This time we will make a different kind of Pizza.Bubblepizza is not flat, but it contains the main ingredients of Pizza: Pizza-dough, tomato-sauce, cheese and other ingredients to your liking.Because everybody's favourite ingredients are different, I will stick to the plain \"Pizza Margherita\". You can add whatever you want to your Bubblepizza.Now, because we are on Instructables, and plain Bubblepizza wouldn't be quite enough, I will show you, how to make Hippo-Bubble-Pizza, as seen in the picture.Let's get started! Step 1: Making the Dough. <PIC> Alright, now let's start with the dough.If you have your own favourite Pizza-dough recipe, of course you can use it.You can also buy Pizza-dough in a supermarket or from your favourite Pizza-restaurant.If you buy your dough, or use your own recipe, you can skip this step. If you want to know how to make Pizza-dough yourself, read on.I made the dough like this:3 and 3/4 cups of flour2 pinches of sugar2 tablespoons of salt1 package active dry yeast1 and 1/2 cups of warm waterand 2 tablespoons of olive-oilPut the dry ingredients in a mixing-bowl and mix them carefully.Add the water and oil and start kneading until the dough starts to form a ball. You can use a mixer with kneading-hooks, or you can do it by hand. If the dough is too wet, add some flour. If it's too dry, add some water.Once the dough starts to form a ball, scrape it out of your mixing-bowl, onto a flour-covered surface. Knead in flour, until the dough stops sticking to your hands and is formable.Put your dough back into your mixing-bowl, cover the bowl with a damp towel and let it rest in a warm place for about 45 minutes.Your dough should have doubled in size by then. Now we are ready for forming! Step 2: Forming. <PIC> Alright, let the fun begin!The dough is ready, now let's start forming.For normal Bubblepizza you take out bite-sized pieces of dough and roughly form them into balls.They do not have to be the same size. The more the size of your Pizza-balls differ, the bubblier the Pizza will look.If you want to add something into your bubbles, now is the time. You can fill them with cheese, for example, knead pieces of onion, bacon, corn, or other things into them, or leave them plain. Use your imagination.Place your bubbles into a casserole-dish with some space between them. (They will rise in the oven.)For the HIPPOS you take one about fist-sized piece of dough. Cut off about 1/3rd of your dough-piece and form the lager bit into a Hippo-body. (Stuff it with cheese, onion-pieces, bacon, ... to your liking.)Place the body into a casserole-dish.From the smaller part of dough, cut off about 1/4th and use the bigger part to form a head and nostrils.Form an eggshape and put it to the body into the casserole-dish. Then gently press it in shape with your fingers to form the nostrils and the face. (I wouldn't recommend stuffing the head, because I think it will be difficult getting it in shape, when you have harder pieces in the way.)The small piece left divide in half and form some round ears. Use a toothpick or something like that to shape them and gently place them onto the head. (Water helps to make them stick.)For eyes and nostrils I used chopped and frozen Basil, but anything small and dark will do. I just think chocolate-chips or raisins do not go well with Pizza... But if you like that sort of combination, go on and try it. ;) Step 3: Finishing and Baking. <PIC> And we are nearly done!Pizza needs tomato-sauce and cheese.For the normal Bubblepizza carefully cover your bubbles with tomato-sauce and pour some in between. Add ingredients to your liking to the sauce. Then cover it all with cheese and put it into the oven. I added some chopped and frozen Basil, but as mentioned before: Add ingredients to your liking!For the Hippos carefully pour tomato-sauce all around them. Add ingredients to your liking into the sauce. Roughly cover the sauce and the Hippos with cheese, but be careful to leave their faces free, so you can still recognize them. Then they are ready for baking.Bake your (Hippo-)Bubblepizza at 180\u00b0C or 350\u00b0F at air-circulation-mode until the cheese turns golden-brown and the tomato-sauce looks very dark at the edges. Time will differ from oven to oven. But I would recommend checking after 15-30 Minutes. Step 4: Enjoy Your Meal!. <PIC> Once baked you can serve the creative Pizza!I hope you liked my instructions and enjoy making Hippo-Bubblepizza.If you liked my instruction and the idea of Hippo-Bubblepizza, please vote for me in the Baking-Contest!Thank you very much and have fun making Bubblepizza in all shapes and tastes!All the best wishes from Austria, Europe.Enjoy your Pizza!!!", "images_list": ["hippo-bubblepizza_0", "hippo-bubblepizza_1", "hippo-bubblepizza_2", "hippo-bubblepizza_3", "hippo-bubblepizza_4"]}

My apologies that I did not take photos of each step, but I hope the photos and descriptions provided will be helpful. \u00a0 Step 1: Make Your Dough. You can use any\u00a0pre-made\u00a0dough or make your own. My favorite recipe is from King Arthur:\u00a0http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/the-easiest-pizza-youll-ever-make-recipe (I use the\u00a0saf red instant yeast option). \u00a0I made the dough a day ahead of time and put it in the\u00a0refrigerator after letting it rise for about an hour and a half. Step 2: Shape Dough. Once the dough is ready and you are ready to construct your Jack Skellington Pizza, the next step is to form a flat, regular circle pizza. The size will vary due to your pizza pan. Use about 3/4ths of the total dough to make the crust. The extra 1/4th will be used to form Jack's eyes, nose, and mouth.\u00a0 Step 3: Molding Jack's Face. <PIC> Now the fun part. I used a can of sliced black olives for the dark spots on Jack's face and dough to form his mouth, nose and eyes. Feel free to use a reference photo if you're not sure how big his eyes and smile are supposed to be.Eyes: Roll dough to form\u00a0cylinder\u00a0shapes, two thicker ones and two thinner / shorter ones. Place the thicker cylinders to form the top of Jack's eyes and the thinner ones to form the bottom of his eyes. Fill the eyes with olives (or your topping of choice).\u00a0Make sure you press it in so it doesn't break off during baking.Nose:\u00a0Use a few blocks of dough to form Jack's Nose - an upside down \"V\". Place olives to form his nostrils. Then take a small piece of dough for the middle of Jack's nose.\u00a0Make sure you press it in so it doesn't break off during baking.Stitched Smile:\u00a0Place the olives to form a regular smiley face smile. Jack's smile extends in a full semi-circle on the bottom of his face. Then use the slice olives to form the stitches in Jack's smile. For the raised part of his mouth: roll out down and cut small rectangles and press them\u00a0in between\u00a0the sliced olives (the stitch part of the smile).\u00a0\n** If you are going to wait to bake your pizza, at this point you can put it in the fridge until you are ready to put it in the oven.\u00a0 Step 4: Time for Cheese. <PIC> Once you have Jack's face the way you want it, it's time to add the cheese. You can sprinkle the dough with a little olive oil first, but it is not necessary (You could also use pasta sauce. I have no idea how the finished product with pasta sauce will turn out, as I made it a white pizza and then had sauce for friend's to dip their pizza). When sprinkling cheese make sure to avoid the olive spots as best as you can.\u00a0\nBake the pizza at 450 for 15 to 20 minutes, until it's golden brown, the toppings are hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted. Remove the pizza from the oven. Step 5: Ta Da!. <PIC> And here is my final result. I didn't use a trick to get the dark spots, but since the cheese is higher at spots, it will brown quicker.\u00a0 Step 6: Sliced and Ready to Eat. <PIC> Here is how we sliced the pizza. Again since this was a white pizza, we had the option of pizza sauce on the side for those who wanted to dip their pizza.\u00a0", "images_list": ["jack-skellington-pizza_0", "jack-skellington-pizza_3", "jack-skellington-pizza_4", "jack-skellington-pizza_5", "jack-skellington-pizza_6"]}

Once very common, in is now fading in popularity. Let's change that.  Step 1: The Fruit. <PIC> Traditionally, rumtopfs would be started in spring, using whatever fruits and berries were available. Other produce would be added later as they ripened. You can use whatever fruit you want, just use your best judgement. Rumtopf can be made mixing a multitude of fruits and berries in one large jar, or just one or a few different fruits and berries in several smaller jars. I would not recommend using blueberries, as they absorb to much liquid, and become rock hard.  Step 2: The Rum. <PIC> Rumtoft is made with rum... obliviously. The brand, colour, colour and flavour is up to you. However you shout opt for a fairly strong one, preferably 50% alcohol by weight. The fruits and berries that is added will leech colour to the rum over time, and a darkly coloured rum will make your rumtopf slightly darker than a clear rum would. Step 3: The Sugar. <PIC> The sugar is included in the rumtopf to help preserve the fruit and berries, so skimping is not recommended. The type of sugar is up to you. The sugar will tend to sink to the bottom of the jar, and you will need to stir or gently shake the jar to help it dissolve.  Step 4: The Making Of. <PIC> To make rumtopf you simply add one part sugar to every two parts of fruits and berries to glass jar, and then add enough rum to submerge it. The recipe is as follows and can be scaled op or down to your preference. 1 kg of fruits and berries0.5 kg of sugarRum to completely cover the fruit, berries, and sugarThe rumtopf should be stored in a dark and cool area for at least three months. Step 5: The Product. When you are ready to consume the rumtopf, separate the fruit and berries from the liquid. Traditionally consumed at Christmas, the fruits can be served on ice cream, on waffles, or baked into a pie. The liquid, now infused with fruity flavours, can be bottled and consumed like any sweet liquor, and stored for several years.

{"id": "RECIPE_936", "question": "What are the essential steps to craft a heavy-duty counter flow wort chiller for brewing?", "provenance": [40611], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Heavy Duty Counter Flow Wort Chiller. <PIC> What is a counter flow wort chiller? In homebrewing, after you've boiled your wort (pre-beer, malty sugar water) for a while you want to cool it down as quickly as possible while also being completely sanitary in order to reduce the risk of contaminating your beer. There are a number of different tools at a homebrewer's disposal to accomplish this task ranging from simple to complex, and cheap to expensive. In this instructable I'm going to show you how I built an all-copper counter flow wort chiller. This particular model allows for thorough cleaning and visual inspection unlike most conventional spiraled versions, while costing about half as much as a store bought model.How does it work? My version of a wort chiller is know as a counter-flow chiller (CFC) which runs the wort through straight 1/2\" copper pipe that is encased by straight 3/4\" pipe. The cold water runs through the 3/4\" pipe and cools the wort down on its journey through the many sections. One advantage to this design is the 1/2\" diameter of the tubing. This size makes it almost impossible to clog with hop debris and cold break unlike traditional plate chillers and smaller diameter CFCs. Another advantage is the ability to partially break down the chiller by removing the silicone on the ends. This allows for a visual inspection to ensure no potentially bacteria-harboring trub is stuck to the sides. Additionally, because the tubing is straight, it is easy to send a small pipe brush through each section unlike a traditional spiraled CFC. Lastly, the unit is fully submersible which allows the brewer to keep it in an ice-bath if desired to further increase cooling potential along with recirculating water for a greater higher water efficiency. The draw back is the price and the size. This unit will cost around $100 to build whereas a traditional round CFC can be built for about half as much. In addition to that my version is big, as it is close to 3 feet long. This model however is heavy duty, capable of cooling large batches quickly, and if properly cared for it will last a lifetime. Step 1: Parts List and Cost. <PIC> The actual material cost for this build was less than I had initially expected. It's still not cheap, but it is a lot less than a comparable store-bought chiller! I've included links to the exact items I purchased and used below. The final project may cost more or less for you depending on what you already have on hand.Material:-2x 10' 3/4\" type m copper pipes $24http://www.homedepot.com/p/Cerro-3-4-in-x-10-ft-Co...-2x 10' 1/2\" type m copper pipes $16http://www.homedepot.com/p/Cerro-1-2-in-x-10-ft-Co...-1x 3/4\" x 1/2\" x 3/4\" pack of 10 copper tees $18http://www.midlandhardware.com/232298-bulk.html-6x 3/4\" x 1/2\" x 3/4\" individual tees $12 + $6 shipping for all the teeshttp://www.midlandhardware.com/232298.html-2x 90 degree 3/4\" copper elbow $6http://www.homedepot.com/p/3-4-in-Copper-Pressure-...-2x hose clamps $2http://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-2-1-1-4-in-H...-solder 9$http://www.homedepot.com/p/Forney-1-8-in-1-4-lb-Le...-flux 5$http://www.amazon.com/Rectorseal-14000-1-7-Ounce-N...-garden hose (a free scrap hose is fine.

Using a pipe cutter (or similar tool) cut the pipe to the lengths listed below. You can make the chiller shorter while using the same amount of copper pipe, however you'll need more tee fittings (and silicone tubing), and you'll want to make sure the length of the inner pipe is evenly divisible by 10' to maximize your copper usage. For example, you could shorten the 1/2\" pipe to 24\" rather than 30\" and have 10 sections rather than 8. This will then require another 2 tees and you'll need to adjust the 3/4\" pipe to match the new size. I will list the measurements I went with.-8x sections of 1/2\" pipe, 30\" long. Since each pipe is 10' you'll get 4x sections from each piece.-8x sections of 3/4\" pipe, 23\" long. -7x sections of 3/4\" pipe, 6\" long.Cut 4x 23\" sections from each 10' 3/4\" pipe. Cut 4x 6\" sections from one 3/4\" pipe and 3x 6\" sections from the other. This will leave you with 1 extra 4\" section and 1 extra 10\" section. Use the 4\" section for the final 2 pieces listed below.-2x sections of 3/4\" pipe, 2\" long. These will be for the connection between the first and last tees, and the 90 degree elbow fittings for the water inlet and outlet.At the end of all the cutting you should be left with the one extra 10\" section of 3/4\" pipe as a spare piece.By this point you should have all of your copper tubing cut and ready to do a dry-fit test! It was at this time that I found my first problem. My tee fittings (and most others by the sounds of it) have a tiny ridge or collar on the inside which prevent the 1/2 copper tubing from sliding completely through the fitting. Next I'll explain how I got around that problem... Step 3: Prepping and Threading the Pipe Through the Tees. <PIC> Once I had all my pipe cut to the right lengths, it was time to prepare it for soldering. First, I used what is called a deburring tool which scrapes the inner lip away from the copper to make a nice smooth interior. I only did this on the inside of the 1/2\" copper pipe where the wort would be flowing through. It is optional, but a good idea to prevent potential trub buildup inside the pipe. You can do the same thing with a dremel tool or a step bit. Once that was done I needed to prep the solder connections. To do this I needed to sand down every surface which needed to be soldered. This cleans the surface and allows for an good adhesion of the solder to the copper in the joints. I used 100 grit sandpaper and sanded the ends of each pipe and the insides of each fitting. There are tools commercially available to do this much easier and faster for about $10, but I didn't have one on hand and sandpaper works just fine. After all the solder points were prepped I could begin assembling. This step was supposed to be one of the easier steps of the process. I assumed that I would be assembling the unit by threading the 1/2\" pipe all the way through the tee and the 3/4\" pipe around it. This turned out to be one of the more difficult tasks of the build... As I mentioned, the tees have a lip inside which prevent the tubing from going further than the intended coupling which unfortunately is the exact thing we want them to do. To remedy this I tried a number of different tactics. I tried a swaging tool which I couldn't get to work with the fitting. I tried a tapered metal rod but of course I couldn't find one the correct diameter. I tried brute force which began to work but since I'd need to disassemble, add flux, then do it all over again I knew this was not an option... I settled on simply using a dremel tool with a sanding bit which was just a hair smaller than the inner diameter of the copper tee. By running the sander over the lip in the tee, I was able to grind it down enough to the point where the tube was finally able to thread completely through the tee. I have also been told that a drill press would work nicely for this as well if you have the correct size bit.Once you grind down the ridges in your tee fittings, do another dry fit to make sure the 1/2\" pipes slide through all the fittings properly. Once you're sure everything fits together nicely you can disassemble it and prepare for soldering! Step 4: Soldering and Assembly. <PIC> Soldering copper pipe was completely new to me. I had never done it before and I was a little nervous to try a new technique on my expensive pile of copper. Fortunately by taking my time, reading a few tutorials, and not getting too anxious I was able to solder the whole chiller in just a few hours. There are 16 fittings with 3 joints each which meant a total of 48 solder points. I learned a few things through all of this which helped me out quite a bit and I hope it will help you as well.I soldered the chiller as I would have assembled it, by starting with the bottom pipes and working my way up. Since The whole joint heats up when you are soldering a single connection, I fount it to be most economical to solder all 3 connections of each fitting at once. This meant adding flux to the inside of each fitting and each pipe end, then sliding the pipe into the tee. The 1/2\" pipe should stick out 1.5 inches from the outside of the tee fitting, and the 3/4\" pipe should fit snug until it hits the stop on the inside of each fitting. Once assembled, heat the joint with the blow torch using a decent sized flame. Trying to do it with a smaller flame takes forever and does not get the fitting hot enough to melt the solder. Once the fitting is nice and hot, test it by touching the solder to the connection point between the pipe and fitting. You're looking for the pipe to melt the solder, not the flame. If you put the solder directly into the flame this will just melt the solder and not let it enter the joint. If the joint is hot enough the solder will melt and capillary action assisted by the flux will draw the solder deep into the joint. I found it easiest to touch the solder to the top of the joint and let it flow down and get drawn into one side, then the other. Add solder until it begins to build up at the base of the joint. This means the joint is full of solder and you can move on. Double check all parts of the connection to ensure there is solder in the joint. Once you've completed the first two straight sections and the one connection pipe between the two, you'll be soldering a tee which is directly over the first one you did. As you heat the new fitting, you don't want your first fitting heating up and loosening, so I found it best to lay a damp cloth over the set joint and wedging a small piece of wood between the pipes to keep the tees apart just a little bit. Continue in this manner until all of your joints are soldered and your chiller is assembled!Once you're all done soldering then you're almost done. Clean off the extra flux with a damp cloth and some soapy water. Take your silicone tubing and cut it into 7x 10\" sections. This will connect each straight section of 1/2\" tube to the next. They will stay very firmly in place with nothing more than friction, so there is no need to further secure these. Last but not least, take your garden hose, chop off the two ends, put the hose clamp onto each section of hose end and work it onto the ends of the 90 degree elbows. You want the water inlet to be on the bottom and the outlet to be on the top. The hot wort will enter on top thorugh the tee with the water outlet and the wort will exit on the bottom with the water inlet tee. Once the hoses are on, secure them to the copper with the hose clamps. Step 5: Final Product and Future Plans. <PIC> This is my finished product! I hooked it up to the sink with another section of hose and ran water through the chiller to test for leaks. I put it under pressure as well and didn't find a single drop of water from any of the joints. I put it to the test and by running my water at about 1/3 pressure I am able to bring a 5 gallon batch of boiling wort down to ale pitching temps in a single pass which took about 7 minutes with the pump throttled back a little bit. The wort inlet and outlet sections are hooked up with a different section of silicone hose and a camlock attachment at the opposite end which connect to the rest of my system at the pump and the recirculation arm in my boil kettle. If I could do it all over again I wouldn't change a thing, but there are some adjustments I plan to make in the future. The garden hose attachments aren't quite as \"sexy\" as the rest of the chiller, and I plan to add proper brass male and female GHT (garden hose thread) sections to the chiller at some point, but this is good enough for now. Additionally, I plan on weaving some copper wire back and forth between the pipes to shore it up and make sure it is nice and straight, but it is plenty strong enough as it is to stay together just by the solder connections alone. This has been my favorite homebrewing build yet and I hope it inspires you enough to make your own!", "images_list": ["heavy-duty-counter-flow-wort-chiller_0", "heavy-duty-counter-flow-wort-chiller_1", "heavy-duty-counter-flow-wort-chiller_2", "heavy-duty-counter-flow-wort-chiller_3", "heavy-duty-counter-flow-wort-chiller_4", "heavy-duty-counter-flow-wort-chiller_5"]}

This great ape is one of the most iconic characters in all of video-game-dom! I was first introduced to DK on the Super Nintendo. I would watch my older brother and sister play Donkey Kong Country all the time, and while I did my best to emulate them I was never quite as skilled. I never got very far in any of the DK games, but what I enjoyed about the games wasn't the challenge of the levels or the feeling of accomplishment after defeating a boss, what I always played for was the scenery and design of the levels. Jungles, ancient temples, pirate ships, volcanoes, beaches, tunnels, mine shafts, anywhere the DK clan went was some place totally unlike anything my little single-digit-aged brain had seen and those were the only places I wanted to be (you can only imagine what happened after I saw the first three Indiana Jones movies).The original concept of this jello shot came to me as I was planning to attend a wrap party for a tropical themed musical my friends had been working on. I wanted to bring them something fun for the party so I whipped up this idea with some input from my ever-so creative girlfriend. I hope you all go as coconuts for it as we did!

Make sure you stir it well so that the coconut milk mixes nicely with the other ingredients. Now place it in a freezer until it's chilled. (Tip: If you're not sure if the mixture is chilled enough, touch the side of the bowl. If it feels freezing cold, then the mixture is, too!)  Step 3: Making Your Gelatin & Cooling Your Jello. <PIC> Pour the contents of 2 Knox Unflavored gelatin envelopes into a large measuring up then boil 2 cups of hot water and pour it into the measuring cup with the gelatin powder. Now stir it all together making sure to  remove all the lumpy-bits. Take your chilled alcohol mix out of the freezer and pour it into the hot gelatin mix. Stir thoroughly!Once you've finished mixing all of your liquids start pouring it into our shot glasses or jello shot cups right away and then stick them in your refrigerator immediately! You'll need to let these guys sit in there for about 2-3 hours before they turn into jello.(Tip: DO NOT PUT YOUR SHOTS IN THE FREEZER! Doing so can be a time saver if you have done it before and know how long to keep them in there, but if you leave them in too long they'll be ruined. Just plan ahead and allow 2-3 hours for them to set properly in a fridge.) Step 4: Toasting Your Coconut Shreds. <PIC> Stove Top MethodTake your sweetened coconut shreds and place them in a small pan. Place your pan on a burner at medium-low heat. Stir or toss your coconut shreds frequently so that there is an equal amount of golden brown and white color to them. Once you have about half of them looking golden brown and delicious, place them in a bowl to cool them off.Toaster Oven MethodPlace your sweetened coconut shreds on a toaster oven sized baking pan and place them in your toaster oven. Set it to toast and keep a watchful eye on it. This method is faster than the stove top, but can also lead to burnt coconut shreds very quickly if done neglectfully.(Tip: An easy way to tell that it is time to stir or toss your shreds  is if you see a little wisp of smoke rising out of the pan.)(Tip: If you don't know what I mean by \"tossing\" your shreds, it's that fancy trick that chefs do when they grab the handle of the pan and flip the ingredients around by shaking the pan.) Step 5: The Fun Step: Serving and Ingesting!. <PIC> After about 2-3 hours, take your jello shots out of the fridge. They should have a nice firm, but jiggly consistency by now.

{"id": "RECIPE_946", "question": "What is the process for creating a delicious ginger cream ale at home?", "provenance": [40617], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Ginger Cream Ale. <PIC> Hi there, I decided to record my latest experiment for pride and posterity. Because this ginger ale is made with some lactose, it will remain somewhat sweet even after a full fermentation. Because it is made with a lot of fermentable sugars as well, it will ferment to a fairly high percentage of alcohol. (an educated guess would be roughly around 8% ABV)  Step 1: Equipment and Ingredients . For equipment, you'll need: A scaleA bowl A large pan (I used a large steam kettle, like a restaurant might have.) A large spoon, for stirring A food processor (or a knife, if you don't mind chopping your ginger by hand) And for ingredients:1 kg corn syrup solids or dextrose1 kg brown sugar 400 g ginger root200 g lactose (milk sugar) 20 g vanilla flavouring A ginger bug or brewers yeastAnd some corn sugar or dextrose for priming. I'll update the amount needed when I finish the batch. If you can't wait to find out, simply google \"priming sugar calculator\" and use it to figure out a precise amount.  Step 2: Measuring. <PIC> Scale out each ingredient and reduce your enemies- er, I mean ginger root, To a pulpy mash in the food processor.  Step 3: Boiling. <PIC> Put all your ingredients (except for the ginger bug culture and priming sugar) together in a large pan and add 3 liters of water. Stir the whole mixture and turn up the heat! Once it reaches a boil, let it cook for another 5-10 minutes and then remove from heat.  Step 4: Beginning Your Fermentation . <PIC> Once your brew has cooled down a bit you can transfer it to an 11 liter pail and add enough water to bring it up to 10 liters. Add your ginger bug (or pitch your yeast, whichever you're using) Close the pail with an airtight lid that's fitted with an airlock to prevent any dust or bugs from getting in while still letting the CO2 escape. (if you don't have an airlock, don't seal the pail tight; leave a crack for the pressure to escape.) Leave the brew in a warm place to ferment for 7-14 days Step 5: Cold Crashing and Racking. Once your brew has completely stopped fermenting, cold crash it in the fridge overnight to force any sediment to the bottom. Once it's thoroughly settled, use a narrow hose to siphon the liquid off. Be careful not to get too much of the sediment through the hose.If you don't have the hose for the job, you can pour the liquid into another pail leaving the sediment behind. You may have to repeat this step once or twice to get your brew more clear. You can save the slurry from the bottom to ferment your next batch with.  Step 6: Bottling . Take 500 ml of your brew and put it on the stove to heat, then mix in your priming sugar. Once it's fully liquefied and hot, remove from heat and mix in another 500 ml of the brew to cool it down. Add the priming liquid to the whole batch and stir it in.  Now fill your bottles! You can use a pail with a spigot or you can pour the brew through a funnel. Cap your bottles and store them in a dark place.  Step 7: Taste Your Sweet Victory. After 7-14 days, your Ginger cream ale should be carbonated. Refrigerate and carefully pour into a frozen glass. Remember to leave the last mouthful in the bottle because there will be a little sediment. Sit back and sip, reap the rewards of your labour! Your brew should continue to improve for about two months after bottling. I'll add more photos when I finish this project.

Here's how to fix it.With our grinder, the buttons for 4,8,10,12 cups seemed to simply do nothing.  It turns out that the shut-off button (top center) had jammed.  Although I managed to get the button out of its cockeyed position, the grinder still didn't work. Step 1: Remove the Beans. <PIC> First, take off the lid from the bean reservoir and empty the beans into a bowl.  We don't need those little buggers bouncing all over our floor! Step 2: Remove the Controls. <PIC> The five buttons (4,8,10,12 cup and shut-off) are all located on a single plastic-chrome piece on the front of the grinder.  Using your fingernail, a very small screwdriver or other implement, insert it at the top in the seam between the chrome piece and the black plastic.  Pry gently, and the entire control panel will probably pop out easily.  It's attached with a few inches of insulated wire, so it won't entirely fall off, and there's no reason to worry about losing any pieces. Step 3: Inspect the Buttons. <PIC> A flashlight will help you get a better look at the buttons.  Each \"outer\" button in turn pushes on a plastic post connected to a button on a circuit board, not too unlike the buttons in your computer's mouse.  In my case, the posts are colored blue, and are sort of hidden inside a spring-like housing that keeps the outer button aligned with the post and provides the recoil on the button.\nI looked at each of the four buttons at the bottom, and there was very little gap between the outer button and the inside posts.  I could see the \"grind\" buttons working correctly as I pushed each of them.  However, the shut-off button was indeed stuck!  The post was sort of stuck in the down position. Step 4: Gently Pop Up. <PIC> Use your very small screwdriver to lift the head of the post.  It may have a bit of a lip on it like mine did, in which case I was able to sort of lift the post out of its \"stuck\" position.  If you think you've got it, compare it to the grind buttons again.  Try out the action of the stop button.  Does the post now depress AND rise again?  Good!\nNow, just like the cardinal rule of working on the internals of your computer:  don't be overconfident;  test your changes now, and don't be cocky, putting everything back together before you know for sure.\nPlug the grinder in and push the \"4-cup\" grind button.  It should buzz to life.  Hit the shut-off button now, gently, so it doesn't jam. Step 5: Replacing the Controls. <PIC> It works!  Now we just have to put things back together.  Be sure that the circuit board portion of the controls fits inside the housing, and guide the controls straight in.  There should be three little teeth that gently snap into place when you press on the panel.\nGet back on that horse and brew some heaven!", "images_list": ["fix-your-melitta-coffee-grinder_0", "fix-your-melitta-coffee-grinder_1", "fix-your-melitta-coffee-grinder_2", "fix-your-melitta-coffee-grinder_3", "fix-your-melitta-coffee-grinder_4", "fix-your-melitta-coffee-grinder_5"]}

This is certainly not true. I thought I'd give it a go anyway as I believe if you kill something you should use as much of it as possible. Killing anything just for the fun of it is blood lust.\nFirstly I'm going to assume you have LEGALLY obtained some swan meat. In New Zealand where I'm posting this from it is legal to shoot 1 swan per day in most parts of the country during duck hunting season. ALWAYS check with local authorities before blowing the S?#t out of anything. I'm sure they are protected in some parts of the world.\nI'm also assuming you know how to harvest the meat from the bird. google or youtube search 'breasting out a goose' will give you some idea of what is involved.\n Step 1: First Experiments With Swan. After I had boned out the breast meat I decided to see what the meat was actually like. So I egg and crumbed a few of the tenderloins and then shallow fried them. I cooked the meat till just well done. \nSwan meat is very lean there was about a quarter of a teaspoon of fat on each breast so it is important not to over cook game as it can become tough and dry.\nHOW DID TASTE?- Well, those people who had been telling me it was tough and foul tasting were wrong. The Meat was very tender indeed, I think this was helped cooking over a medium heat and not over cooking the meat. Swan does however have a very gamey taste, it's one of those tastes you either like it or you don't.  \nCertainly all myths about taste and toughness have been dispelled, but with almost no recipes available I was left wondering what to do with the rest of the meat?  Step 2: Enter the Hamburger. <PIC> Burgers are a one of my favourites and there's nothing like a nice flavoursome patty, so I decided to see how swan would work in a burger.\nthe key to successfully cooking game is to match the intensity of the flavours.\nfor this patty recipe I used;\n1 swan breast (about 1lb)\na few dashes of worcestershire sauce\nRosemary \nSage \nBread crumbs\nPepper\n1 egg (optional if the meat is looking a bit dry add an egg otherwise leave it out)\nYou'll also obviously need;\nburger buns\nlettuce, tomato etc\npickle\nMayo \nand fruit chutney- Iike tamarillo (red egg shaped south american fruit) but peach, apple will work well.\n Step 3: Get Making. <PIC> If you have a mincer then feed the meat and herbs through it, other wise you can make a coarse mince by chopping the breast into smaller and smaller pieces with a knife. If you do use a mincer put a slice of bread through after the meat to push any left over mince through when the bread starts to come through turn off the machine.\nAdd worcestershire sauce and pepper and mix. \nNote I don't add salt to patties of marinates as salt can draw moisture out of the meat instead I salt the meat just before cooking or even after cooking.\ncheck the consistence of the mince, when you stir it it should stick together reasonably well if it doesn't bind well add an egg and a handfull of bread crumbs this will help the patties hold together during cooking.

I love meat. Probably more than you do. But unfortunately, meat is typically expensive and a pain to prepare.-Enter the lentil-\nLentils are amazing. Sorta like beans, they are super cheap when you buy them in bulk (~$1/lb or less). They also make a fantastic meat substitute. Cooked on their own, they don't really have a taste, but they will acquire the taste of whatever you cook them with. Green ones have a meaty texture, while red ones cook down into a refried beans texture. They are full of protein and lots of other stuff that I won't bore you with.\nThis is probably one of the easiest, most healthy, tastiest chilies you will ever eat. I've had people taste it and say they would pay money to eat it at a restaurant. The beauty of it too is that you can add literally whatever you want to it. This is just a framework.YOU WILL NEED\n\t\t1 cup each dry red and green lentils, rinsed\n\t\t1 can of diced tomatoes, or 1 large tomato, diced\n\t\t1/2 a can/jar of spaghetti sauce (any kind will do)\n\t\t1/2 cup chili powder\n\t\t3 cups water\n\t\t1 bouillon cube, chicken or beef works best\n\t\tPepper to taste\n\t\t2 tbsp olive oil\nThis is the bare minimum required for the chili.\u00a0OPTIONAL STUFF\n\t\t1-2 bell peppers, diced\n\t\t1 whole bunch of celery, diced\n\t\tCarrots, diced\n\t\tSpicy stuff (Aleppo pepper works very well for this)\n\t\tetc etc...\nNow on to the good stuffs.\u00a0\nDissolve bouillon cube in the water. In a large pot with a lid, add the olive oil and heat over medium heat. Add in any veggies (unless you are using canned tomatoes, don't add those yet). Cook the veggies in the bottom of the pot for about 5 minutes. Add everything else to the pot. Stir until the chili powder is dissolved. Cover the pot and raise the heat to high. When the chili begins to boil, reduce heat to low (2-3 on the dial if you have one that goes to 9-10). Cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and let sit with the lid on for another 30 minutes.\u00a0\nThis makes a lot of chili, at least enough for 5-6 large servings. It's much cheaper than buying canned chili, tastes better, and is way better for you. If you added spicy stuff, the longer you keep it, the hotter it will get. Leftovers last at least a week in the fridge, although you probably won't be able to make it last that long.\u00a0\nThis is fantastic with scrambled eggs for breakfast, as a side dish, or as a main dish with some mozzarella on top.

Being in the Balkan cultural crossroads we consume every type of coffee and Turkish coffee is one of the most popular drinks. Turkish coffee for us represents a social activity and entertainment in the form of fortunetelling. Step 1: Materials. <PIC> Turkish coffee is very easy to make. I tend to buy Turkish coffee from a specialty store because it tastes like the one at home but you can use any type of coffee. The trick is to grind it as finely as possible. You will need an ibrik or any sort of small metal cup you can heat up on the stove and water.IngredientsFinely ground coffee Water Sugar (optional)UtensilsIbrik or a small metal pot or cup Espresso sized cups Step 2: Preparation. <PIC> Preparing Turkish coffee is very easy. Just follow these steps:Fill the ibrik or cup with water and bring the water to a boil. When the water boils, turn off the stove. If you are using a gas stove, just turn it off. If you have an electric stove, move the ibrik off the range for the moment. For each espresso sized cup, put a level teaspoon of coffee into the pot and stir. If you like sweet coffee, add the sugar before you add the coffee. You should get a nice coffee foam on the surface when you stir. Put the ibrik on top of the range and if you are using a gas stove turn on the low heat Now this is important: let the coffee boil once more very quickly. It will start to rise and spill out of the pot, so be quick in turning off the heat or removing it from the range if using an electric stove Pour the coffee into cups immediately Step 3: Serving. <PIC> Turkish coffee is usually served in ornate cups about the size of espresso cups. Often, a cube or sugar or other sweets are served with the coffee. Once the coffee is consumed, you can flip the cup over to get your fortune read.

Here I have used red beets grown in our own garden, hence the relatively small size, but you can also buy then in your local store. I serve them with meat or put them on sandwiches, and due to the preserving pickling liquid they keep until next years harvest! Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> 1kg red beetsPickling liquid:6.5dl clear vinegar (7%)5dl water3dl sugar2ts caraway seedsAdd all ingredients to a pot and bring to a boil while stirring. The liquid is ready for use when the sugar is dissolved. Step 2: Sterilizing the Jars. <PIC> Bake clean glass jars at 115'C (240'F) for 10-15 minutes. Turn the heat off and leave the jars in the oven until you need them. The lids are covered in boiling water for a few minutes and then put aside. Be careful, they are hot! Rubber gloves are helpful. Try not to touch the inside of the glasses or lids after the sterilzation process. Step 3: Boil and Peel the Red Beets. <PIC> Remove the leaf stem and lower part of the root. Boil them until coocked. The time depend on the size of the beets, mine took approx 30 minutes. They are done when you can easily insert a knife through them. Remove the water and peel them while they are hot. While wearing rubber gloves for protection, squeeze the beet and the peel pops right off. This is so much easier than peeling them prior to boiling.IMPORTANT: These vegetables are rich in color. Be careful with where you put the beets and what you touch with your hands afterwards! Step 4: Cutting the Beets. <PIC> Cut the red beets into thin slices and put them into the jars. You can use a knife or just an egg slicer like me. The jar can be quite full. Step 5: Adding the Pickling Liquid. <PIC> Add the pickling liquid while it is hot until all the red beets in the jar are covered.

Our goal is to keep the cost of each wrap around or under $10.Here's a video tutorial for those that would like to follow along:https://youtu.be/mFrZ9FWULiw Step 1: Shopping. You're going to want to pick up a few ingredients.Required:Fully Cooked Chicken Breast StripsFully Cooked Bacon StripsShredded Cheddar CheeseRanch DressingTortilla WrapsOptional:Hot SauceHimalayan Pink SaltParsley (or your favored seasoning)LettuceBlack Pepper Step 2: Choppin' Block. First off, stack and cut your bacon into more manageable sized pieces. Effectively large bacon bits. If you want, nows the time to add the pink salt. If you do, it'll compliment the smokey flavor nicely, but don't overdo it or the bacon will become sweet as the flavor of the salt carries. Lightly microwave the bacon so the grease pulls the salt in.Next, cut your chicken into smaller pieces as well. We will be blending the two together later so you're going to want bite sized chunks.Your chicken will most likely be frozen so go ahead and thaw it with the microwave as well. Step 3: The Colonel Would Be Proud. Now that the bacon and chicken are chopped up, you're going to want to season the chicken. Mine was already lightly seasoned, but barely. I chose to go with a bit of parsley and ground black pepper, but lemon pepper would've been something I would've preferred to try. Add your seasoning as desired. Step 4: Sauce Boss. If you blend a bit of hot sauce in with Ranch Dressing you can make some real magic happen. All of the flavors of pepper and spice will come out, but the heat is reduced greatly by the taste of the ranch.We're going to pour the two into a bowl and blend them together with a spoon.Your aim will likely be a light pink color, so that the ranch isn't smothered by the hot sauce but equally the taste of the sauce can be detected under the ranch. Don't be afraid to tap a bit onto your finger and adjust your ratio as you stir. Step 5: Drizzle Yo Sizzle. Now that everything is ready, you're going to lay down your tortilla on a plate and stir your two meats together.It is optional to microwave your tortilla for a few seconds at a time to warm it and make it a bit easier to roll.Once you're ready, add your meat evenly across the tortilla, then sprinkle your cheese across as if you were making a burrito.Once these two layers are down, use your spoon to spread the sauce across the top and roll. Step 6: Snack Attack. <PIC> Now that your snack wrap is rolled and ready to go, you can either store it in the fridge and keep it for later, or you can pop it in the microwave for a few seconds.If and when you do the latter, you'll melt the cheese and fill in all the little gaps in between the chicken and the bacon.

This is easiest with a bread machine, but you can certainly knead the dough by hand. Step 1: Get Your Ingredients!. <PIC> For a 2 pound lump of dough (good for 2 pizzas), you'll need these ingredients:3/4 teaspoon salt4 cups bread flour2 teaspoon active dry yeast1 1/2 cups beer (12 oz. bottle)1/4 cup olive oil1/2 tablespoon sugar Step 2: Warm the Beer. <PIC> Heat the beer in the microwave to a temperature of 100-110 degrees. Be careful, it can fizz and foam if you shake it or stir it too vigorously. Pour it in the bread maker pan. Step 3: Mix Ingredients. <PIC> Place all ingredients into bread machine pan. Insert pan securely into bread maker. Step 4: Run Dough Cycle on Bread Machine. <PIC> Close the lid on the bread machine, and plug it in. Depending on your model, select the Dough cycle. Press the Start button. The machine will begin to knead the dough. Keep an eye on it as you need to ensure that the dough is not too dry and not too wet. You SHOULD lift the lid occasionally in the first few minutes of the kneading process to check. If it is too wet, add a tablespoon of flour at a time, waiting a minute or so after adding. If it is too dry, add a tablespoon of water at a time, waiting a minute or so after adding. The dough should stick to the sides a little bit, yet congeal into a moist ball and move around from time to time in the pan. Check out my YouTube video for the way it should look. Step 5: Shape Dough Into Pizza Crust and Bake. <PIC> Check out how that dough has risen! Let it touch the lid before you take it out, even if it takes longer than the dough cycle timer. I usually give it an extra hour, for a total time of 2 1/2 hours. The dough can now be turned out of the pan onto a floured surface and shaped into the pizza crust. Remember, this recipe makes enough dough for two pizzas. If you want, you can refrigerate the dough in a gallon sized Ziplock bag for a couple of hours up to a couple of days to make it a little less temperamental to work with. Have some fun pressing and shaping it into a pizza! Use a pizza stone if you have one. The crust will be crispier if you preheat the stone for 10 minutes at 450 degrees. Then, sprinkle a little corn meal, semolina, or flour on there, and finish shaping the pizza crust. Add sauce, cheese, and toppings. Bake your pizza for 10-15 minutes at 450 degrees.

Step 1: Get Your Stuff Ready.. <PIC> You are going to need a few things before you start.The list is as follows;Apple, green or red doesn't matter.Lemon, try for a medium lemon, you will not use all the juice.Peeler.Melon baller.Knife, I used a Ceramic knife to stop the browning.Toothpicks.Medium plate.Small bowl, the deeper the better.Breadboard.You will need all the above, if you don't have a knife the peeler can be used. Step 2: Prepare the Lemon.. <PIC> OK, you have all the equipment needed lets begin.Cut the lemon in half and juice it, it is alright if seeds fall into the juice.When you have juiced the lemon you need to pour it into the bowl and add about four drops of food coloring.Stir in the red food coloring with one of the toothpicks until it is evenly spread throughout the lemon juice. Step 3: Prepare the Apple (the Full Size One!). <PIC> OK, now we need to peel the apple.Make sure there is no skin still on any of the flesh of the apple.Do not discard the skin, instead put it aside; we will be using it to make the leaves for the apples.When the apple is peeled and the skin is set aside you can continue to the next step. Step 4: Leave Me Alone!. <PIC> Time to make the leaves!Start by taking the skin we set aside and cut the end at an angle like i the first photo.Next, cut it on the opposite angle to make half a diamond.We need to complete the diamond as shown in the third and fourth photos.When that is done you have your first leaf!Make as many leaves as apples. Step 5: Mini Apple Time.. <PIC> Now, we take the melon baller and press it into the flesh of the apple like shown in photo 1.Twist it in a scooping motion and cut out a small dome, it should be a semi circle but if the bottom edge isn't flat don't worry.Because of the density of the apple it is hard to get a perfect circle, it is also hard to cut it with the melon baller.Now with the two halves we need to put them together, they probably won't fit well due to the roundness of the apple, we need to trim a little bit off so it is a flat surface.After flattening out the edges we can put it together, take a toothpick and skewer it through the middle of the half spheres like shown in the third photo.By using the toothpick as a handle you need to dip the apple into the food coloring mix we made earlier, the apple will not be 'red' but most apples you see in shops aren't fully 'red'.After dipping we thread on the leaves and present them on the plate.If you don't like the idea of leaves you can leave them out. (no pun intended)The toothpick is needed to hold the apple together and it also doubles as a stem.Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!", "images_list": ["cute-miniature-apples_0", "cute-miniature-apples_1", "cute-miniature-apples_2", "cute-miniature-apples_3", "cute-miniature-apples_4", "cute-miniature-apples_5"]}

{"id": "RECIPE_1035", "question": "What is the process for crafting your own homemade smoked chili powder from fresh peppers?", "provenance": [40671], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Homemade Smoked Chili Powder.. <PIC> I have been asked many times about my homemade spices. Here is the one that started them for me. I love to garden and enjoy growing peppers, but often have to many to eat fresh. I decided to start drying them by accident one time by a few of the hot ones drying up on there own. The smoked flavor came later after I decided to roast them over an open flame and let them sit for a few hours near the smoldering coals. Hickory I find to be the best, alongside hard maple. Step 1: Step One: Grow the Peppers. <PIC> Homemade and home grown here! Peppers in season are the best flavor, if you don't have a garden, do yourself a favor and find a farmers market or some place that brings them in fresh and in season. Step 2: Step 2: Roast Peppers Over Wood Fire Grill.. <PIC> You want to roast the peppers before you let them smoke. All varieties of peppers roast a little different. With meaty peppers like poblanos, Anaheim, jalape\u00c3\u00b1o or bells (not recommended because they really don't add much for flavor) you want to turn the skin black but not char the meat. The thin walled hot peppers seem to go very quick and sometimes even completely dry out to a crisp in the smoke. You want to watch them and rotate as needed. As said before I like the hickory or hard maple the best for the smoke flavor. You see them here in my wood grill/ smoker. I like to keep one side as indirect heat so I have full control over the temp. Step 3: Step 3: Let Them Smoke.. Let the flames die down and smolder adding chunks (not chips) to the coals only as often as needed to keep it from going out. I find placing a large chunk on the coals will smoke for a good while before it starts to catch fire. You do want to watch for open flames and all peppers should be in an indirect heat zone. If you get flames spray them out with a spray bottle of water and close the lid quickly and the combo of water and smoke will choke out the flame. I watch it for about 2 hrs. I find this step to be good after having cooked a nice BBQ dinner and roasting an smoking while the wood grill is starting to wind down Step 4: Step 4: Dry Them.... <PIC> Hot peppers will dry on there own in a window, but meaty peppers need some help! I have used the oven set at 170F but it uses too much energy and 170 is a little too hot, but can work if that's all you have.

I used to squirm at the thought of consuming anything I considered un-pure or unhealthy. For over a year, I put severe restrictions on my diet and basically only ate uncooked vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, which is a rather expensive and time-consuming lifestyle. I had to put several hours each day into planning, acquiring and preparing my meals.Carrots are one of the cheapest, easiest vegetables to acquire and I happen to be a big fan of those friendly, orange roots. I kind of lived off of them for a while, not really considering the consequences that might lurk in The Dark Side of Raw Foods. Due to the massive overdose of beta-carotene my body was receiving and the lack of starches to soak up the excess, my skin turned an extremely disturbing orange colour. I\u2019m pretty sure I burned all the photos taken of me during my hairy hippie phase, so I have no orange hue to show you. Unfortunate\u2026 it was impressive.I might also add, that I had The Worst Gas Possible when I was eating raw foods. Even though it was over a decade ago, I still feel bad for the girl I drove cross-country with. I\u2019m sure she felt like she was riding with a camel. Looking back on that time, I squirm so much more about orange skin and bad gas than tossing back a bit of snake soup, frog sashimi or random bug. I still love carrots, though. We have been through too much to let go of our relationship because of a skin tone set back. It was a little rude of them, but I let it go. The Chutney family is a rowdy group of condiments that hails from South India. They usually contain some mixture of spice(s), vegetable(s), and/or fruit(s) and there are many varieties. Chutneys may be either wet or dry, can have a coarse to a fine texture and can contain either fresh or pickled preparations. This little chutney is rockin'.

Here is the video, paired with Asian Tacos... recipe coming shortly!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JlSTHdRC1k Step 1: Prepare the Pomelo. <PIC> Pomelo is a large, fleshy citrus with a hint of sweet grapefruit flavor.

At this point, you may choose to peel around the pomelo to cut off the majority of the membrane, or you may choose to section the pomelo and separate the membrane from the flesh. However you choose to do it, you want to end up with a bowl of pomelo flesh. Side note: There aren't many seeds in a pomelo!

Do the same for the mushrooms. Place both bowls aside and move onto the avocados, English muffins and prepping for the grill.First, start up the grill, preheating it to your desired temperature. I start off on high, get the grill hot, clean it with a brush, and then lower the temperature to low. Next, take your two ripe avocados, cut them into slices and set aside. Slice the English muffins in half and place them aside too. Using some heavy duty aluminum foil, make a tray that you can cook the mushrooms on in the grill. Now you are ready to actually start grilling.Place your aluminum foil pan on the bottom rack of the grill, pour the mushrooms along with their marinade onto the pan and let it cook. Next, add the chicken breast onto the top rack and cook thoroughly. Since the chicken breast are thin sliced, the cooking time will be shorter. Make sure to keep an eye on the mushrooms, because if the oil cooks off the balsamic will begin to reduce and form a thick caramel coating before starting to burn. Once the chicken and mushrooms are done, you can place them in the same large bowl and set aside.  With the grill still going, take the English muffins and toast them to your desired texture.Lastly cook up the Bearnaise sauce. I save this step for last because it cooks so fast and you must constantly stir it so it does not burn to the bottom of the pan. The package I used called for 1 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of butter ( I cut the butter down to 1/8th, and it was fine).  Mix all the ingredients and packet contents into a pan.  Bring mixture to a boil, while stirring constantly. Once it boils, remove from heat and continue to stir until it no longer wants to stick to the bottom of the pan.Now that everything is done cooking, it is time to build it! Step 3: The Build Up and Serve. <PIC> First place the English muffin on the bottom.  Add a slice of chicken, trimming it up a bit if  too large.  Next, add a few slices of avocado followed by a nice big slice of portabella mushroom.  Lastly, top it all off with Bearnaise sauce and enjoy!

I wanted to get in touch with  my inner chemist, so I decided to make some theobromine shaped chocolates and show you how to make them too! Theobromine is a bitter alkaloid found in chocolate and other foods. It has the chemical formula C7H8N4O2. Materials you will need:Vacuum form machinePET (also known as PETE is a food safe plastic .04 or .02 thickness)chocolateoptional (chocolate toppings)double boiler (or pot and metal bowl)stovespatuladrillmaterial to laser cutLaser cutter (or other way to make original)Refrigerator Step 1: Preparing the Original. <PIC> The first step to creating our mold is making the original. (an original is the form that a mold is made from) I used a laser cutter to make mine so the first step will be creating a tool path for the laser cutter to follow. I made mine using Illustrator. The file is attached, feel free to use it or make up your own!Through experimentation I found the best way to make the part was to laser cut the molecule and base as two separate pieces. I used .125\" thick acrylic for my original. Try to keep your material thin so it won't get stuck in the vacuum formed mold but thick enough that your chocolate won't break when you take it out of the mold.Once your parts are cut out and collected from the laser cutter glue the molecules onto the bases. Try to keep them as centered as possible. I used a plastic glue, some options include plastic weld and epoxy.After the parts have cured completely add draft angles onto the bases by sanding down the edges to about a 45 degree angle. This will help in releasing your part from the vacuum form mold.The final step to preparing your originals for molding is adding air vents to the interior details. The vacuum form machine works by pulling heated plastic onto the part through vacuum suction in the bed. In order to allow the air to pull plastic in the center of the original you need to build holes into your part that let air pass through the part. You can further aid the vacuum by raising the piece off the bed very slightly by placing the original on pennies.  Step 2: Vacuum Forming the Mold. <PIC> If you don't have access to a vacuum form machine here's an Instructable that shows you how to make your own.https://www.instructables.com/id/Vacuum-Forming-Rig/The first step to running the machine is turning it on and allowing the heaters to warm up. This may take a few minutes depending on your machine, plastic and environment. As the machine is warming the plastic, place your originals on the bed (you may want to put pennies underneath the parts to help get more suction on the part). Once the plastic has begun to sag a few inches it's ready to be pulled. Place the frame over the bed creating a seal and turn on the vacuum. This should pull the heated plastic onto the parts into all the details.Keep the vacuum running until the plastic has cooled a bit so it won't deform. Once the plastic is cooled a bit turn off the vacuum and pull the frame off the bed. If any of the originals are stuck in the mold push them out.Your mold is now ready to make chocolates! Step 3: Making . <PIC> First thing you will want to do is clean your mold. Although PET is food safe your originals might not be and the plastic may have picked up dirt on the vacuum form bed. Now gather your chocolate making supplieschocolate (I used chips but you can get melting chocolates)double boiler (or pot and metal bowl)spatulaculinary brush (optional)The chocolate moldSet up your double boiler. Or if you don't have one use a DIY double boiler like I did. Place a metal bowl inside a pot (make sure the bowl is big enough to create a seal it's important that water doesn't make it into the chocolate) Fill the pot with a few inches of water and place it on the stove at a LOW setting. It's important that you don't burn the chocolate so don't turn the heat too high and be sure to stir constantly. Once the chocolate is completely melted use the brush to paint a thin layer of chocolate into the molds. Try to get into all the details. (brushing isn't necessary but it will ensure that there are no air bubbles in the chocolate)Now fill the rest of the mold with chocolate using the spatula. Smooth out the tops and set them in the fridge to cool for about 15-20 minutes. Once they're solid pop them out of the molds and enjoy the theobromine goodness!", "images_list": ["chocolate-molecule-chocolate-mold_0", "chocolate-molecule-chocolate-mold_1", "chocolate-molecule-chocolate-mold_2", "chocolate-molecule-chocolate-mold_3"]}

I could have substituted with cake flour (which I\u00a0do\u00a0have in my pantry ;-) but I really wanted to keep the recipe authentic at it's base level.\u00a0\nInstead of driving 52 miles to buy a spendy 24oz. bag of Bob's Red Mill (yielding nearly 6 cups of rice flour that I might never use up), I decided to search the internet to see if it was feasible to make (copycat) the same rice flour myself... and it was!\nHere's my easy (somewhat improved ;-) adaptation from\u00a0Susan of India.Tools needed:\n\t\tBlender\n\t\tFine-mesh Strainer\n\t\tPaper towels\n\t\tLarge Skillet\n\t\tHeat-resistant Spatula\n\t\tSifterIngredients:\n\t\tWhite Basmati\u00a0Rice- Raw (not instant rice)\n\t\tWater\nEvery cup of raw rice will yield almost 1 1/4 cups of sifted Rice Flour.Step 1: \u00a0Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold running water. Drain briefly. \u00a0Put the rice into a bowl and cover with cold water. Soak for 3 (minimum) to 6 (maximum) hours.Step 2: \u00a0Drain the rice in a fine-mesh strainer for 10-15 minutes. \u00a0Spread the rice out on a triple layer of paper towels to dry for an hour or so. \u00a0The rice should be just slightly\u00a0damp... not wet.Step 3: \u00a0Use your blender to grind the rice in 1/2 cup increments. Begin with the pulse setting, allowing the rice to settle in between 3 second pulses. When the rice has broken down into small granules, blend on high until the texture is powder-fine. Repeat this process until all the rice has been finely ground.Step 4: \u00a0Heat a large skillet over medium heat. \u00a0Working in 1 cup increments, add the rice flour to the pan. Stir constantly\u00a0until all of the steam has evaporated. \u00a0Continue cooking for a couple more minutes.Note: The resulting rice flour should be snow white.\u00a0 If it begins to brown, immediately lift the pan up and lower the heat.\nTest for doneness (dryness) by taking a pinch between your fingers. Properly dried flour will not stick together.\nRemove from heat and cool to room temperature.Step 5: \u00a0Sift the rice flour. \u00a0Return any residual \"clumps\" back into your blender for reprocessing, then sift again.\u00a0\nStore refrigerated in an airtight container... or get cookin'... because now you have rice flour for that special recipe you've always wanted to try. \u00a0\nThanks for stopping by!", "images_list": ["diy-how-to-make-rice-flour_0"]}

Have you wanted to try one but didn't because you're a vegetarian? Well, that's how I felt. My boyfriend sometimes gets them whenever he has to go into work and doesn't have time for a good meal. And in retrospect, they're not really un-healthy. All it is is chicken (in my case, vegetarian chik'n), lettuce, a dab of ranch dressing and a sprinkle of cheese all wrapped up in a tortilla. You could go healthier and use a whole wheat wrap instead of a tortilla as well. Yum! In order to make these, you'll need: 1 Tortilla (I used a small soft taco sized one, but a bigger one will work) 1 MorningStar Farms Chik Patty Handful of lettuce Handful of shredded cheese (I prefer sharp cheddar, or a Mexican blend) 1 plop of ranch dressing (I only like a little bit, use more if you want) I know these are pretty lame ways to measure, but it's really up to your preferences how much you use. Step 1: How to Make It. <PIC> First, you need to heat up one of Morning Star Farms chik'n patties. Throw it in the microwave and slap some numbers until it's heated. I heat mine for one minute and fifteen seconds. While that's heating, you can grab a tortilla or a wrap and put the rest of the ingredients inside. After your chik'n patty is done heating, go ahead and slice it into four pieces and place them in your tortilla. Now you're all done! Pretty easy, right?

Making the ginger bug (Bug- 1 week). Step 2. Mixing the ginger bug with sugar water (Brew- 1 day),Step 3. Fermenting the mix (Bottle-2-3 weeks).It takes about three to four weeks to make a batch of ginger beer from scratch and there are about 50 days left in the Homebrew contest so that should be just enough time to achieve fermentation, updating this instructable as I complete each step. Complicating this challenge will be the fact that I recently moved and I don't have access to all the supplies/ utensils I would normally have. I'll be making it up as I go along, should be interesting :DEDIT: I have exams next week so I may run a bit behind but for now, this is the tentative ginger beer scheduleBug- June 9-17Brew- June 18Bottle- two weeks from June 18 to the first week of JulySo, here we go... Step 1: Make the Ginger Bug. <PIC> 09/06/2016Ginger bug is a culture made from fresh, grated ginger root and sugar. You will need three ingredients to make the ginger bug;-one large ginger root-approximately 1 cup of sugar-one bottle (500mL) of bottled water. (Don't use tap water as it has been treated and may kill the bacteria we are trying to cultivate in the ginger bug.)You will also need the following utensils/ tools;- grater-wide neck glass jar-a piece of fabric to cover the jar- elastic band or piece of string to secure the fabric around the jar-plastic or wooden spoonTo begin, grate about 2 tablespoons of ginger into the jar, add two tablespoons of sugar and two table spoons of water. Mix well, cover with the fabric and secure with an elastic band.  Leave the jar on your kitchen bench or some other out of the way place where it wont be disturbed.Every day for seven days you will need to add 2 more tablespoons each of grated ginger, sugar and water, stirring the mixture well with every addition.By the third of fourth day you should start to notice bubbles forming in your bug. This is good :D- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - -- - - - - - - -- - - - - - - -- - - - - - - -- - - - - - - -- - - - - - - -- - - - - - - -- - - - - - - -PS. I have bought the ingredients and will start my bug tomorrow. Pictures to follow. Stay tuned. Step 2: Ginger Bug- Day Zero. <PIC> 10/06/2016Get your ginger, peel it if you want to, I just washed mine. Grate enough to make two tablespoons. I didn't have a grater so I used a knife.This amount of ginger made about one and a half tablespoons which is fine. Measurements don't have to be exact and I can make it up by adding more ginger tomorrow.Add the grated (or chopped ginger) to the glass jar. Add two tablespoons of sugar and two tablespoons of water.Mix well and cover with a cloth, secured with an elastic band.Leave it in a corner somewhere and go about your day.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Days 1 to 7 will follow the exact same steps- add ginger, sugar, water. Mix. Cover and set aside. Step 3: Ginger Bug- Day 1. <PIC> 11/ 6/ 2016Added more grated ginger to the bug today, about 3 tablespoons.Added two tablespoons each of sugar and water but the water barely covered the ginger pieces so I added a little more, just enough to completely cover the ginger.Mix everything up, cover and set aside.See you tomorrow :)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Step 4: Ginger Bug....Bubbles!!. <PIC> So a few days have passed since my last update. I've added several lots of sugar/water/ginger to the bug but may have missed a day or two (due to having exams and stuff).When I've made this previously I started seeing bubbles after three or four days but this time around I didn't see anything after four days and I was starting to worry that I would have dump this and start again but this morning I woke up to find bubbles! Yay!!Now I need to buy some lemons for the next step (this weekend). Step 5: Something Is Wrong With My Ginger Bug.... I was supposed to brew and bottle the ginger beer today but it looks like the ginger bug is not ready. I haven't seen an increase in the amount and size of bubbles (which I was expecting) so I think it needs a few more days, maybe another week :(I have split the bug into two jars and will continue adding the ginger/water/sugar each day. Hopefully in a few more days more bubbles will start to form and I can begin the brewing.18/06/2016 Step 6: Disaster!. <PIC> I woke up this morning and checked the ginger bug only to find this alien spawn had taken over... goodbye internet glory :(This is the first time I've had a batch fail. I've only made 4 or 5 batches over the past few years but I've always tended to have beginners luck with anything I try- the first few times it is perfect and then disaster creeps in.In this case I followed all the same steps so I have to guess that it has something to so with the ingredients I used, most probably the ginger...maybe it wasn't organic? I'm really not sure.Unfortunately, if I have to restart the bug that messes up my schedule and I dont think I'll complete my ginger bug in time for the end of the Homebrew contest. I may start a new batch this weekend (after my last exam).Thanks for reading this far. I'll add a link to a ginger beer instructable if/ when I start a new one.20/06/2016", "images_list": ["ginger-beer-home-brew-live-blog_0", "ginger-beer-home-brew-live-blog_1", "ginger-beer-home-brew-live-blog_2", "ginger-beer-home-brew-live-blog_3", "ginger-beer-home-brew-live-blog_4", "ginger-beer-home-brew-live-blog_6"]}

(I bought a Porter Cable pc750ag from Lowes for $39) Flapper disk for angle grinder ($5 at Lowes or Home Depot)Stainless Steel cutting disk for angle grinder. ($5 at Lowes or Home Depot)Flat head screw driverHack sawDrill and drill bitPliersParts you'll need:6 inch stainless steel hose clamp2 inch outside diameter by 2 1/2 inch long slip coupling.  Step 1: Step 1: Mark and Cut Channels for the Angle Grinder's Handle. <PIC> Big picture for this step: You are trying to cut openings or channels on either side of one end of the pipe to hold the handle of the angle grinder.Use a measuring tape to measure a half inch from one end of the pipe coupling.Mark with a sharpie all the way around the pipe at 1/2 inch.Measure the width of your angle grinder's handle. Mine was just about 1.18\" or 3cm.Now look straight down at the coupling and hold the angle grinder handle across the end of the coupling. Use your sharpie to make cutting reference marks on the end of the coupling.Remember we are trying to cut channels or openings for the angle grinder handle.Use your hacksaw to cut into the coupling about half inch at each of those reference marks.Use a pliers or dremel to finish opening the channels. Take your time!Fit the angle grinder handle in the channel and test for fit. Step 2: Step 2 - Cut the Two Holes for the Hose Clamp. <PIC> Big picture for this step: The handle will need to be secured to the coupling with a hose clamp. Clamp the coupling down so you can drill through it.Find a drill bit that is about the width of your hose clamps.Use your sharpie to mark a spot on the coupling that is perpendicular to the channel and about 1inch from the end of the coupling.Drill through both sides of the coupling. Take your time!Test the hose clamp for fit. Step 3: Step 3 -  Prep the Keg. <PIC> Big Picture for this step: Prepping the keg If your Keg still has a valve in it, then you need to make sure it is NOT under pressure. Don't proceed unless you are sure that the keg is depressurized and the valve is out.Search Google to find out how to depressurize a keg and take the valve out. There are plenty of videos on Youtube that show you this step.Assuming that your keg is prepped. Move the keg to the garage or outside.Attach the stainless steel metal cutting disk.Hook up the angle grinder to the Keg jig (the coupler). Slide the Keg jig all the way to the base of the handle and tighten with a screwdriver.Get Eye and Ear protection. Wear gloves, long pants and shirts. Cutting steel is very loud and there will be sparks. Step 4: Step 4 - Cutting the Keg Top. <PIC> Big picture for this step: The keg jig will allow the angle grinder to scribe or cut a circle in the top of the keg. Make sure you have 360 degree movement around the keg.Make sure your angle grinder has a long enough cord. Make sure you have several feet of room around the keg.Without turning the Angle Grinder on move the grinder around in a circle. See if it moves freely. Sometime Keg handles are bent.Ok, start up the angle grinder.Use some pressure to scribe a circle around the top of the keg. Instead of trying to cut through the steel in one pass, try multiple passes.It takes about 5-10 minutes and the keg top will drop.

When using a pectin poor fruit, pectin must be added or the result will be nothing more than a fruit syrup. I refuse to use store bought pectin because I think it takes the craft out of jam and jelly making. Usually I just add apple skins and cores to whatever I'm making, but I thought I'd give making my own pectin a try.\nThe basic method is to take a pectin rich fruit and extract the water soluble pectin by boiling it, then concentrating the liquid. Apples are a good source of pectin because they both contain a lot of pectin and have a relatively neutral flavour (as opposed to orange peels for instance). Step 1: Ingredients and Tools. <PIC> Pectin is concentrated in the cores and skins of all apples, and is especially strong in tart green apples. Using the cores and skins left over from making a pie is a great way to upcycle your scraps. For this instructable I used crabapples that didn't have enough flavour to bother with crabapple jelly.Ingredients:\n3 lb Apples\n4 cups Water\n2 Tbsp Lemon JuiceUnusual Tools:\nJelly bag/cheese cloth and strainer\nI am using the basic method from www.pickyourown.org, a website with a lot of very helpful information. Step 2: Cook Apples. <PIC> If using whole apples remove any imperfections that may impart an off flavour, and cut the apples into quarters or so. Place into a large pot with the water and lemon juice and simmer until the apples are completely tender, but not disintegrated. This could take between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on your apples and how large the pieces are.\nStrain the results through a jelly bag to extract only the liquid. If you are concerned about cloudiness don't squeeze the bag. If you don't have a jelly bag (though I highly recommend getting one if you plan on making jelly) you can line a strainer with a few layers of cheese cloth. Step 3: Reduce Liquid. <PIC> To concentrate the pectiny goodness, boil the strained liquid until reduced by half. Stir occasionally to avoid getting a film.\nIf you want to test the level of pectin in your reduction, put a few drops into rubbing alcohol and the pectin will gel almost instantly. Obviously this should not be eaten. Step 4: Store and Use. <PIC> To store the pectin you can can it as you would any other preserve, but I think it is more convenient to freeze it. I froze mine in an ice cube tray and transfered the cubes into a ziplock bag. You can now use the frozen pectin cubes in jams and jellies made from low pectin fruits. Step 5: Example of Use. <PIC> This spring (2 years later) I used some of my frozen pectin cubes to make rhubarb jelly. Because your pectin concentrate and project will be unique this is just an example to get you started.\nFirst I extracted the juice from the rhubarb by boiling and straining it.\nI added a few cubes of pectin and tested the pectin level using a method that I found in Joy of Cooking: All About Canning. To test the amount of pectin I placed 1 teaspoon of juice in 1 tablespoon of rubbing alcohol then fished out the congealed pectin with a fork. A low pectin mixture forms loose strands of pectin while a high pectin mixture will form a single gooey ball.\nOnce the pectin level was looking good I carried on as usual, adding sugar and cooking the mixture until it passed the jelling test.\nRemember that it can take 1 to 3 weeks for jams and jellies to set.", "images_list": ["pectin-from-scratch_0", "pectin-from-scratch_1", "pectin-from-scratch_2", "pectin-from-scratch_3", "pectin-from-scratch_4", "pectin-from-scratch_5"]}

Thankfully she was down with making a different type of a szarlotka rather than the same one we did two weeks ago. Clearly, the Traditional Szarlotka was a huge success and my parents loved it. That\u2019s exactly the reason why my mom wanted to come up with a Szarlotka recipe of her own.\nPersonally, I like the Traditional recipe better. It\u2019s sweeter. I think it\u2019s because in the other recipe, we cooked the apples before putting them in the filling, and that helped the apples let its juices out \u2013 therefore making the filling sweeter. In this recipe, we don\u2019t cook the apples. We simply grate them and use them fresh in the recipe which makes for a totally different experience.\nAlso, we didn\u2019t use any regular sugar in this recipe, the only sugar is from pure honey.

Our family owned a diner at one point and we would sell out of it nearly every day. I only make it during the holidays and give the loafs as gifts. I only make it once a year because otherwise I'd be eating it everyday and it's not exactly a healthy snack. There is a lot of sugar in it. I'm going to be showing you how to make the lazy man's/woman's version.\u00a0 It's best served hot. Some popular ways to eat it are; grilling or toasting it with butter, or making french toast with it. Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> \nIn the lazy version I buy premade bread doughs at the supermarket. They're also called pizza dough. I've never had trouble finding it so just ask an employee if you have trouble. Also these ingredients are a guide so don't fret if you're over or under a bit.\n1 Dough (1.5 lbs.)\n1Cup Granulated Cane Sugar\n1\u00a0 Cup Brown Sugar\n1/2 lb. Box of Sugar Dots/Cubes\n4 Tbs. Cinnamon\n1/2 Cup Soft Butter (1stick)\nThat's it! Very simple. Please note that there a lot more ingredients in the picture then you will be using. I'm making 21 loafs right now. :) Step 2: Prepare Your Tools. <PIC> \nLine the bottom rack of your oven with foil. This is essential because there is almost always molten sugar spillage and it's a real pain to get off the bottom of the oven. Set the oven to the lowest setting. Mine goes down to 175 degrees fahrenheit.\u00a0 Spray the bottom of your 2\"x6\" mini loaf pans with a non stick baking spray. Step 3: Make the Bread. <PIC> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First mix together White & Brown Sugar and Cinnamon and set aside.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Take your dough out of the bag and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Punch it down and start to stretch it out. It'll take a few to get it to stay because it will want to shrink back down. Once you've stretched it into a rough 15\"x20\" rectangle, spread the butter over it, covering the entire surface.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now get your sugar/cinnamon mixture and spread it over the butter. Try to cover the whole surface.\u00a0 You will probably have extra.( You can store that for some special toast sprinkles later (: ).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now it's time for the sugar cubes. Sprinkle the sugar cubes over the dough. You will be using 1/3 to 1/2 half of the 1lb box. Starting at the end closest to you, start to roll the dough. You kind of want to stretch it and squish it a little as you roll to get everything mushed together and to keep the outside edges uniform. When you get to the end the last 2\" or so should have no sugar cubes. Take that area and stretch it forward over the top to close everything up. Step 4: Divide Dough & Let Rise. <PIC> After you're done rolling up the dough, cut it into 3 equal pieces. On the raw edges you'll want to poke your finger into the center and try to somewhat seal up the ends. You won't be able to completely seal it, that's ok. Place each piece into a greased pan. Put the pans into the oven but don't close the door. Also shut the oven off and cover the pans with a clean dish towel. Leave the breads to rise for about an hour. They are ready to bake when they are about double in height. Step 5: Bake the Bread. <PIC> Bake the bread at 350 degrees fahrenheit\u00a0 for about 25-30 minutes. Don't forget there should be foil on the bottom rack! The bread is done when it's browned on the top. Let the bread sit in the pan for at least 20 minutes before turning out or you will have a gooey mess. The sugar needs to solidify a little first. And enjoy!

The day, that I walked in through the door and smelled the cake instantly, I could feel a big smile coming on because I knew that, my mom had baked a cake. This cake, wasn't any type of ordinary cake it was a freshly baked tres leches cake. My mother, always said that if, the cake wasn't made from scratch it wasn't a cake that would make a persons heart smile. So, for this cake we will show you how to make a tres leches cake from scratch. Step 1: The Ingredients . <PIC> So first we should probably get out the ingredients so that we aren't all over the place as we are mixing and baking. So here is what you will need as far as for the cake.The cake:6 eggs of good size, separated (make sure they are cold it helps!)2 cups  of granulated sugar2 cups of all-purpose flour2 teaspoons of baking powder1/2 a cup of whole milk1 teaspoon of vanilla extractCream topping:-1 12 -ounce can of evaporated milk-1 12 -ounce can of sweetened condensed milk-1 cup of heavy creamIcing:-store bought icing/cool whip(really what appeals to you) -yummy fruits of your choosing like mangos, peaches, papaya, strawberries etc.  Step 2: To Make the Pre-cake . <PIC> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease and flour a 9 by 13-inch baking dish and set aside. Step 3: Making the Cake Mix. <PIC> In the bowl of a mixer, beat the egg whites on low speed until soft peaks form. Add the sugar gradually with the mixer running and peak to stiff peaks. Add the egg yolks 1 at a time, beating well after the addition of each. Mix together the flour and baking powder and add to the egg mixture, alternating with the milk. (Do this quickly so the batter does not lose volume.) Add the vanilla.  pour into pre-set pan bake until golden, around a 25-30 minute wait Step 4: Making the Cream Topping. <PIC> while you wait on the cake to finish baking we will work on the delicious cream part.To make the cream topping: In a blender, combine the evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy cream and blend on high speed.once cake is  done let it cool a little then take it out from the oven and while still warm, pour the cream mixture over it. (a helpful tip, it helps to poke holes in the cake before you pour the cream in it,so that it is very moist.) Let sit and cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours so that the cream soaks in well to the cake. Step 5: The Wrap Up. <PIC> Now here is where you get to really get to throw yourself into the cake because you can really put a little of you into it because every on likes to decorate their cakes differently. Plus for me the decorating part is always the funnest because it appeals to your eyes and even though you are supposed to go for what captures your heart and not your eyes, cake does both.

{"id": "RECIPE_1146", "question": "What\u2019s the best way to prepare COLD OIL French fries and potato chips for a delicious snack?", "provenance": [40743], "ground_truth": "Introduction: COLD OIL French Fries & Potato Chips. <PIC> \n          Hot, crispy homemade french fries and potato chips make a healthy comeback with the unorthodox method of cold frying. \u00a0\u00a0 Here are 4 excellent reasons why you should stop everything you're doing and try this... right now!\u00a0  1. The preparation couldn't get any easier or faster. (less than 15 minutes for fries!) \u00a0  2. Your stove top remains virtually grease-free because there's no explosive flash-spatter.\u00a0  3. Cold frying produces healthier french fries with\u00a0less\u00a0fat than conventional fries. \u00a0  4. Best of all: \u00a0These fries (and chips) taste\u00a0absolutely\u00a0 f.a.n.t.a.s.t.i.c. \u00a0 They're so\u00a0delicious\u00a0and soeasy, I've completely abandoned traditional hot-oil frying... for french fries, anyway. ;-)\u00a0 Are you skeptical? \u00a0The proof is in the\u00a0pudding potato. ;-) \u00a0I want to\u00a0will make a believer out of you! Let's get started! Step 1: Ingredients and Tools:. <PIC> \n          You'll need potatoes, oil and salt. ;-)Potato Types:\u00a0  \u00a0  \u2022 Small (6-8 oz) Russet potatoes: Young \"bakers\" have less starch than their mature jumbo \u00a0 siblings. Less starch = crispier french fries. \u00a0Make sure your potatoes are fresh and firm. \u00a0Save the large tubers for smashed or baked taters. ;-)  \u2022 Yukon Gold potatoes: They're reported to be low in starch. \u00a0I haven't bothered to try them because Russets are delicious, less expensive and they're always available.\u00a0  Bottom line: Feel free to experiment. \u00a0I tend to think White or Red rose potatoes are\u00a0too high in starch to make a good french fry, but that's just speculation. \u00a0Maybe you have a\u00a0tuber-exotica\u00a0in your pantry? \u00a0Why not try it? \u00a0  Top Secret confession: Don't tell jessyratfink, but I did make\u00a0an earnest effort to improve her Sweet Potato Fries using the cold-fry method. \u00a0The sweet potato gods weren't impressed with the results and neither was I. \u00a0When I say \"Jessy's recipe ain't broke\", I speak from first-hand experience. ;-)Oil Types:  \u00a0  \u2022 Vegetable Oil- Excellent  \u2022 Canola Oil- Very Good  The beauty of cold-frying is that the oil never reaches the smoking-point before the potatoes are finished cooking. \u00a0While I'm sure higher quality oils (such as peanut) would produce great results, I haven't tried them. \u00a0I also haven't tried cold frying with Olive or Coconut oil, but I wouldn't hesitate to experiment with them. \u00a0Please give me the 411 if you do. \u00a0I'd love to hear your results!Tools:  \u2022 A deep,\u00a0heavy saucepan or dutch oven. \u00a0Flimsy aluminum or cheap stainless steel pans are not recommended. \u00a0They just don't hold the heat well. (I tried an aluminum pan once and the results were awful!)\u00a0\u00a0It's important to choose a saucepan deep enough to allow 2 inches between the top of the oil and the rim of the saucepan.  I use a 3 qt T-Fal saucepan. \u00a0It has enough room to cold fry 2 potatoes for french fries or potato chips.Please: DO NOT use a frying pan or skillet for cold-frying. \u00a0Shallow pans are NOT safe for large amounts of very hot oil. \u00a0  \u2022 Tongs, a spider or even a pasta claw  \u2022 Paper towels\u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0 Step 2: Cold Oil French Fries. <PIC> Zero-hassle prep: Scrub the potatoes and slice them horizontally into 3/8\" sticks. There's no need to pat them dry unless you just can't stop yourself. ;-)Fry: Stagger/criss-cross the raw fries in layers as you put them into the heavy saucepan. \u00a0Cover completely with oil.\u00a0 Put the saucepan on the burner and turn the heat to \"high\". \u00a0When the oil begins to boil (about 5 minutes in) use tongs or a fork to stir the fries. This helps keep them from sticking together. \u00a0Let the fries boil in the oil 5 minutes longer and stir them again. \u00a0\u00a0 Continue frying for a few more minutes. The bubbling will subside and the fries will begin to brown. When golden, remove them from the oil onto a layer of paper towels. \u00a0Salt and serve devour immediately. Bon app\u00e9tit! P.S. The leftover oil can absolutely be reused. Cool and store it in a container until tomorrow. That's probably when you'll be craving another batch of awesome, easy, delicious homemade french fries!\u00a0 Step 3: Cold Oil Potato Chips. <PIC> Unlike cold oil fries, potato chips do require some advance preparation. \u00a0You need to remove as much starch from the chips as possible before frying. Otherwise, they'll stick together while frying and get chewy instead of crispy. :-(Prep: \u00a0 Thinly slice the potato with a mandoline or potato peeler. \u00a0Place the raw chips in a large bowl and cover the completely with water. \u00a0(The water will turn cloudy right away. That's the starch being released from the spud.) \u00a0Refrigerate for 30 minutes, an hour, or even overnight.When you're ready to fry, put the chips in a colander and rinse briefly under cold-running water. (This helps remove any starch that may have settled between the slices.) Allow to drain for several minutes. Pat dry with a paper towel. \u00a0It's fine to have some moisture... you just don't want them dripping-wet.Fry:\u00a0 Since potato chips have more surface area than french fries, you'll need to use more oil. \u00a0Put the chips into a heavy saucepan and spread them out a bit. \u00a0Add enough oil to the pan so the chips are completely covered, then add\u00a0at least another\u00a0inch.\u00a0Put the saucepan on your burner and turn the heat to \"high\". \u00a0 After about 3 minutes, the oil will begin to bubble around the walls of the saucepan. Give the chips a gently stir with a fork. \u00a0Wait a few more minutes until the oil reaches a rapid boil and stir again. \u00a0Gently stir the chips every few minutes. (You'll be able to feel their texture go from soggy to firm to crisp right through the fork.)\u00a0 As the oil bubbles begin to subside the chips will start to lightly brown. \u00a0When they're golden, remove them from the oil and place on a layer of paper towels to drain. Salt immediately. For optimal crispiness, let the chips cool for a few minutes before serving.\u00a0 \u00a0Caveat: These chips can go from \"almost done\" to \"over-done\" in a span of 20 seconds. \u00a0Keep a close eye on them Step 4: Author's Notes and Credits:. <PIC> This Instructable was inspired by member dirtymac. \u00a0We were discussing the fat-factor on my Instructable\u00a0Half-baked French Fries.\u00a0\u00a0He referenced and shared an article from America's Test Kitchen about cold-frying. (article here) Well... I've been cooking since the stone-age... and I'd never even heard of cold-frying! \u00a0I was intrigued by (and skeptical of) the entire concept! At the time, ATK didn't offer a tutorial on the process, so I just started experimenting. \u00a0In hindsight, I'm really glad I wasn't influenced\u00a0jaded by any previously published accounts of cold oil french fries.\u00a0 In writing this Instructable, I've since revisited the topic with a recent Google search. There are a few tutorials online now. \u00a0I had to giggle when I discovered\u00a0two very reputable\u00a0sources (who shall remain nameless: Cook's Illustrated and ATK ;-) unequivocally dismiss Russet potatoes as \"too starchy\" for cold oil frying. \u00a0lol... not!\u00a0 This, my Instructable friends, is my favorite part of any story. It's the part where I get to jump up and holler \"YES, you CAN!!!\" ;-D\u00a0 Thanks for stopping by and P.S.

This cake is good on the first day - but is excellent a day or two later, after the cherry-goodness has had a chance to soak into everything!  Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> Cake:2 c. sugar1 3/4 c. flour3/4 c. cocoa powder1 1/2 tsp baking soda1 1/2 tsp baking powder1 tsp salt2 eggs1/4 c. milk3/4 c. juice from maraschino cherries (the cherries come into play for the filling)2 tsp vanilla extract1 c. hot water Frosting: 3/4 c. butter, softened1 1/2 c. cocoa powder5-6 c. confectioners sugar1/3 c. cherry juice (if you don't have any left, you can substitute for more cream/milk!) 1 tsp vanilla*up to 1/2 c. heavy cream (or milk) - just enough to adjust frosting consistency Filling:a little more than half of your frosting2 boxes Cherry Cordial candy, chopped3/4 c. maraschino cherries, chopped Step 2: Cake. <PIC> Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0FCombine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt and set aside. In a large bowl, mix together the oil and sugar, until the sugar is well coated. Add in the eggs 1 at a time, mixing well after each one. Add in vanilla and milk. Mix in part of your combined dry ingredients, followed by some of the cherry juice, then more dry, more juice, until all ingredients (EXCEPT the hot water!) have been added. Mix well, until batter is smooth. Now carefully add the hot water, mixing well and adding slowly so that the batter temperature is raised evenly. Pour cake batter into 2 prepared 9\" cake pans.Bake for 30-35 minutes.Allow to cool 10-15 minutes, remove from cake pans, and then finish cooling completely.  Step 3: Frosting/Filling. <PIC> For your frosting, cream together your butter and cocoa powder. Slowly add in 2 cups (or so) of confectioners sugar, followed by the vanilla and cherry juice. Continue adding in the rest of the sugar. Towards the end, if the frosting starts becoming too thick to mix, add in cream or milk as needed. Mix well until smooth and creamy.For the filling, take a little more than half of your frosting (set the smaller amount aside) Into the filling portion, mix in the chopped maraschino cherries (no juice!), and chopped cherry cordial candies. This will make the filling thinner, but not so much that you're unable to work with it. *- If you want to mix the cherries and cordial candy into all of your frosting, you definitely can! I just wanted the outside of my cake to be smooth =) *If your frosting does get too runny, you can try chilling it. If it's still too runny, add in more confectioners sugar until it's thickened again.  Step 4: Layers and Frosting. <PIC> Cut each of your cakes in half, to create 4 layers. Layer your cake and your filling together - I like to stick the cake in the fridge for a few minutes between layers to help the filling set some and prevent the cake from sliding or squishing the filling out. After all of your layers are completed, wrap well with plastic and let chill until it's safe to work with (if you live in a cooler area, you might be able to skip this step - but my cake was still too soft to attempt to frost.)Finally, finish off with your smooth frosting!

Once that's done, place all the chips into a bowl or a ziplock bag, then add the olive oil, dried basil, garlic powder, ground turmeric, pili-pili, cayenne pepper and the pinch of salt to the chips.

Step 1: What You Need. <PIC> What you need:- 1 pack of 6-to-a-pack pecan spins (or twirls) in the plastic tray, most local grocery stores have them in the bread aisle.  Mrs. Freshley's (R) is a common brand, but others are out there.  Usual price from $0.80 to $1.20.- 1 container Betty Crocker (R) whipped butter cream frosting (or other brands/flavors per your preference).  Usually in the baking goods aisle for around $1.70.  Alternatives: make your own butter cream or cream cheese icing; plenty of recipes on the web (I can't vouch the nutrition info will be the same, though the price will probably be lower).- 1 spatula or butter knife.- Half-tablespoon measuring spoon, if you're precise.- Plate (reduce trash, use a recyclable paper plate, or a washable plate).- Microwave oven (standard disclamer: microwave ovens are all different, cooking times may vary). Step 2: Prepare the Rolls. <PIC> Place two to four pecan rolls on a paper plate.  If you're adventurous, or cooking for two, place all six.Open the icing container.Drop about a half-tablespoon of the icing onto each roll and spread with the knife or spatula.Place the plate into the microwave and cook the rolls for about 10 seconds.  The icing should melt and become somewhat runny, like a cinnamon bun's icing should be.  If not,  move the rolls around on the plate, and zap 'em for another 3 or 5 seconds.Careful, they will get hot.  Please, be careful.  Do not drop a hot cinnamon roll in your crotch and sue me.  In fact, if you want to try this, you will promise to be careful, and monitor children, and will not get litigious should any harm befall you, your kin, pets, homework, electronics, or other property.(Yes, I know, I'm not funny.) Step 3: Eat the Rolls. <PIC> Being careful not to burn yourself, pick up one of the rolls and consume by placing into your mouth, biting, chewing, and swallowing.  Don't rush this step.  Savor that warm, creamy, cinnamon-y flavor.  It really does taste just like a Minibon (R).Alternative: you may use an eating utensil known as a \"fork\" to act as mediator for pieces of food between the plate and your mouth.  Having recently had jaw surgery, I had no option.  Normally I can eat these things whole.My wife's assessment:  \"These things are too damn good.\"That's it!Notes on the pictures: you can see in the pictures how the icing melts into the nooks and folds of the cinnamon roll, and melts into the cinnamon filling of the roll.  The last picture shows what any Cinnabon (R)-eater has seen in the bottom of a Cinnabon (R) carton: liquefied icing mixed with cinnamon.  I tell ya... there's really no difference in flavor.  When I'm jonesing for a cinnamon roll, these are my go-to snack now. Step 4: Cost and Nutrition Value. Because the icing is a bulk item and has enough icing for about 56 spins (at a half-tablespoon apiece) that's 18 cents for six spins.  Total cost, then, is about $1.40, assuming a price of $1.20 for the pecan spins... that's 23 cents per serving (one spin).  Even if you add a few cents for the electricity to nuke the spins, it's still less than half the price of the official Cinnabon (R) Minibons (R).Nutritionally, here's how the Minibons (R) looked:Nutrition FactsServing Size 1 rollAmount Per Serving:Calories 300Calories from Fat 99Total Fat 11gTotal Carbohydrates 45gDietary Fiber 0.5gHere's how our \"home-made\" versions look, adding up the values for the spins and the icing:Nutrition FactsServing Size 1 rollAmount Per Serving:Calories 125Calories from Fat 46Total Fat 4.8 gTotal Carbohydrates 19.8 gDietary Fiber 1gI'd say that's pretty good!

{"id": "RECIPE_1193", "question": "What\u2019s the process for creating a delicious sumac and lemon pepper seasoning from scratch?", "provenance": [40770], "ground_truth": "Introduction: How to Make the Spice Sumac and Sumac Lemon Pepper. <PIC> Sumac is a spice used mainly in middle eastern cooking.  It adds a sour note and a beautiful red color to food, much like lemon peel adds sourness and yellow.  I find that Sumac's sourness is much quicker to fade and has almost no aftertaste.  Not surprisingly, the spice Sumac comes from the plant Sumac.  So let's start Step 1: Collect Your Sumac and Supplies. <PIC> Warning Do not eat any wild food unless you can positively identify it.  Sumac is one of the easier wild foods to identify though.  It has red clusters of berries rising above the foliage.  Don't worry too much about poison sumac, for while it shares a name, it has white berries, not red ones.You will want to collect the clusters during a dry period, as rain can wash out the acid that makes them sour.  Collect as many as you think you will need, but keep in mind that 1 cup of berries is only about 1 1/2 teaspoons of spice.  It shouldn't take very long to collect all the berries you need for a years cooking.Let your berries dry in a cool dark place for a week or two, as this makes the spice much easier to seperate from the seeds.You will need, 1- sumac clusters2- a sifter, strainer, or colander3- a blender, herb grinder, or food processor Step 2: Grind Your Sumac Berries. <PIC> Put the berries in a food processor, or blender.  I am using a cheap herb grinder.  You don't need to worry too much about power, as you are knocking the dry fruit off of the seed.  Pulse them in the blender for a while until the seeds are mostly yellow and there is red dust seperate from the seeds.This red dust is your spice. Step 3: Strain the Seeds Out of Your Sumac . <PIC> Put the mixture through a strainer, colander, or mesh.  I used a flour sifter, as it moves the seeds well and lets the spice fall through.  This red spice is Sumac.  If you taste it you will notice that it is very tart, but the sourness fades quickly.  You can use it as is, sprinkling a little on chicken breasts or fish.  It is also delicious on vegetables or kabobs.Or you can make red lemon pepper with it. Step 4: Make Red \"lemon\" Pepper and Enjoy. <PIC> Mix the Sumac with freshly ground pepper, 1/3 pepper to 2/3 sumac.  It will have a tendancy to clump somewhat, but don't worry too much about that.  Put into a spice shaker and use just as you would lemon pepper.  Delicious on zuchinni or grilled veggies.Here is some Red-lemon pepper on a steamed chicken breast.  It made a normally bland meal delicious.I hope that I have given you some ideas on how to use this wild edible, and I hope you have found that this expands your options in the kitchen.Live a hands on lifehandsonlife.org", "images_list": ["how-to-make-the-spice-sumac-and-sumac-lemon-pepper_0", "how-to-make-the-spice-sumac-and-sumac-lemon-pepper_1", "how-to-make-the-spice-sumac-and-sumac-lemon-pepper_2", "how-to-make-the-spice-sumac-and-sumac-lemon-pepper_3", "how-to-make-the-spice-sumac-and-sumac-lemon-pepper_4"]}

It's a sweet, tart syrup that tastes great in mixed drinks or on pancakes. With minor cooking alterations, this recipe can also be used to prepare juice or jelly. Step 1: Ingredients and Supplies. <PIC> Ingredients:1 gallon of fresh raspberries 3 medium stalks of fresh rhubarb 1 cup water Approx. 3 cups white sugar (variable to taste) Supplies: cheese cloth 2 large pots wooden spoon potato masher ladle butcher string half pint mason jars (at least 5)tongs (even better if they're designed for canning, but they don't have to be) Step 2: Preparing the Syrup . <PIC> 1. Add water, rhubarb, and raspberries to pot. On medium heat, alternate between mashing and stirring.2. When the rhubarb breaks up easily (15-20 min.) remove from heat.3. Cut 3-4 layers of cheesecloth to fit over an empty pot (leave at least 3 inches of slack all around). Pull it taught, tie it on, and start ladling the stew over the cheesecloth.4. Let it drip and cool for at least 10 minutes. Carefully gather the cheesecloth from under the string, and tie the pulp into a sac. If you're patient enough to really let it cool, you can squeeze the excess juice with your hands. If its still too hot, use a masher but be careful not to break the cheesecloth.5. When you've got as much juice as you can out, add the sugar and stir as you bring to a boil. 6. Let simmer on low. It's a matter of taste how long you want to reduce it. The longer you wait, the thicker the syrup will be (until it sets as a jelly). Reduce it down by a couple cups, and you should get a nice thick syrup that's still runny enough to pour. *Keep in mind, you won't get to see the true consistency until it's set and refrigerated, so don't wait for it to thicken in the pot. Also, you want your jars ready to go when your syrup is still really hot, so start sanitizing them while it's still reducing.**Suggestion: Save the pulp to make fruit leather instead of discarding it. Step 3: Canning the Syrup. <PIC> 1. Fill a large pot with enough water to just cover your jars, add the rings (but make sure you don't put the lids in yet!), and bring water to a boil. Let it boil a few minutes, then turn it down to simmer.2. Remove jars (one at a time) with tongs, and ladle in the syrup (remember to leave about a half inch of room for air pressure).3. With tongs, dip the lid in the simmering water for about 30 seconds (just enough to heat the glue without melting it), then immediately put on. Rings can wait a bit. I screw mine on after all my lids are prepared.4. When rings are on snug, put them back in the simmering water for 30 seconds or so. This step isn't always necessary, but a good precaution to make sure they all pressurize right.You're finished! Enjoy it with whatever you like, give it away, or store it indefinitely.

With bananas. And cocoa. And coconut. Also a little spicy. Behold, the Spaghetti bananara. Yes, that is quite a stupid modification of 'carbonara'.First, you need to cook yourself some spaghetti. I used half hard wheat and half wholegrain. Throw them in boiling water with a little salt and a bit of butter. Boil for maybe 8min, until desired consistency, then strain.Then cut two bananas into slices. Put them on a pan. Add enough butter, shredded coconut, cocoa (I would have used pure cocoa powder, but only had instant cocoa drink powder, which also contains some sugar and tons of all the stuff they put in industrial food for no apparent reason) and ground cayenne/chilli pepper to taste. Add enough so you can feel it, why put it in otherwise? You don't need to add any sugar, the bananas are sweet enough for themselves.Start roasting this. Mix well, so the bananas are covered with butter, cocoa and coconut mixture.Roast and mix all the time. Bananas will soften and lose their shape, which is what we want.When there's something a little closer to a sauce than to sliced banana on your pan, pour it over your spaghetti like you would a regular sauce. You can top it with sour cream for example, but I had none, so I didn't.Now enjoy the genius of cooked bananas with the genius of spaghetti, all on one plate.I must say this idea was a little more on the \"awesome\" than on the \"stupid\" side.Substitute butter with coconut oil for vegan.Substitute wheat spaghetti with gluten-free pasta for gluten-free.Substitute cocoa drink powder with pure cocoa powder for sugar-free.Substitute flame with cool winter breeze for raw.Substitute spaghetti bananara with water for not hungry.I'll be happy to read your comments.If you liked these sweet spaghetti and/or my first instructable, you can also vote in the contest.

DISCLAIMER: This recipe was adapted from The Professional Pastry Chef: Fundamentals of Baking & Pastry, by Bo Friberg. HLPERRY is not responsible for the outcome of any recipe. You may not always achieve the results desired due to variations in ingredients, cooking temperatures, errors, omissions, or individual cooking abilities. Please always use your best judgment when cooking with raw ingredients.\nPerfect chocolate chip cookies should be slightly underbaked so they stay soft and chewy\u00a0 on the inside, and lightly cripsy on the outside. You can add chopped walnuts to these if you are so inclined - I left them out because my husband doesn't like them. I discovered this recipe in a pastry chef text book I received as a gift (from an aunt convinced I should get paid for this stuff). The text book is meant to be worked through in a cooking class with demonstrations, so there are not many pictures or visual explanations. I thought putting it into this format could be helpful, because the techniques described worked really well for me. In the past I've ended up with thick, doughy cookies or\u00a0 too-crisp cookies, and these turned out just like they do at your favorite bakery.\nDifficulty: Average\nYield: 48 cookiesINGREDIENTS:\n9 ounces of unsalted butter, room temperature\n6 ounces of light brown sugar\n6 ounces of granulated sugar\n2 eggs\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n13 ounces bread flour\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n12 ounces of semisweet chocolate chipsWHAT YOU'LL NEED (or what will make your life easier):\nhand or stand mixer (dough hooks recommended but not necessary)\nlarge mixing bowl\ncutting board\nsifter\nwooden spoon\nsheet pans\nparchment paper\nknife\nspatula\ncooling rack Step 1: Step One: Cream the Butter & Sugar. <PIC> Preheat oven to 375 degrees.\nBeat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together, using the dough hook at medium speed (I've used regular mixer attachments with no problems). Add the eggs and vanilla.  Step 2: Step Two: Add Dry Ingredients. <PIC> Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt together; mix into the batter. Stir in the chocolate chips (and walnuts, if desired). Dough should easily come together and form a ball. Step 3: Step 3: Divide the Dough. <PIC> Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces, approximately 1 pound each. Roll each piece into a rope 16 inches long and cut each rope into 16 equal pieces.\nI like to line up a tape measure with my rope of dough and mark it at one-inch intervals, then slice. Step 4: Step Four: Get Ready to Bake!. <PIC> Place the pieces, cut side up ( you do not need to roll the pieces round),\u00a0 on sheet pans lined with parchment paper. Stagger the cookies so they do not bake together. These cookies end up being 2 1/2 - 3 inches in diameter. Step 5: Step Five: the Finish Line. <PIC> Bake the cookies until just done, about 10 minutes. The cookies should still be a bit sticky in the middle and just slightly brown at the edges. In my experience, if you let the tops get too brown, you're going to have a very crunchy cooky once they cool! If that's your jam, so be it, but consider yourself warned :)\nI like to move the cookies to a cooling rack after a few minutes, to completely cool. Then, you can store them in an airtight container for a few days (if you have any left).\nEnjoy your cookies!", "images_list": ["how-to-make-perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies_0", "how-to-make-perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies_1", "how-to-make-perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies_2", "how-to-make-perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies_3", "how-to-make-perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies_4", "how-to-make-perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies_5"]}

Oh and you want it to taste fancy too? Well, here is a fun little twist on a classic dump cake recipe to help you out! Step 1: You Will Need:. <PIC> To make your very own super delicious and amazingly awesome dessert, you will need: 9x13 (or slightly larger) baking dish Oil or cooking spray At least 20 ounces (up to about 40) of cherry pie filling Vanilla extract 2 sticks butter Mini chocolate chips 1 box light colored cake mix (yellow, white, or lemon for sure work) Measuring spoons, butter knife, and large spoon for stirring Optional: Pecans or other nuts for topping (not shown in this 'ible) Step 2: Filling. <PIC> Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Coat the bottom and sides of your baking dish with cooking spray or oil. I actually was so excited to make this that I forgot to do it - it does make clean up a lot easier later. Dump in your cherry pie filling. I only used about 20 ounces of filling in this dump cake. It was tasty, and everyone liked it, but I thought it could have used a better filling-to-cake ratio. Add about 1 Tablespoon of vanilla extract, a little more or a little less to suit your taste. I wouldn't go too much less though. Finally, add 1/3 to 1/2 cup or so of mini chocolate chips. Add the larger amount if you use more than 20 ounces of cherry pie filling. Or if you just REALLY like chocolate :) Now stir it all up to get the vanilla and chocolate chips mixed in, and smooth it out along the bottom of your baking dish. Step 3: Topping. <PIC> Now for the dumping of the cake! Take your box of cake mix, and dump the whole thing on top of the cherry pie filling mix! w00 for cooking! Gently smooth the cake mix out over the entire dish, all the way to the sides, breaking up any big clumps as you go. Gently is important, you don't want to incorporate the cake mix with the pie filling mixture. Slice your two sticks of butter and place all along the top. You don't have to cover every bit of cake mix, but you do want to have even coverage without huge gaps. If you are going to add nuts for topping, add them at this point. Usually I've seen nice neat rows of pecans rather than a sprinkling of chopped nuts - but feel free to play with it a bit!  Step 4: Cooking. <PIC> Pop your baking dish, uncovered, in your preheated oven for 45 minutes to an hour. Start checking it at the 45 minute mark. This was my cake at 45 minutes. It is just starting to get golden, but it is still a little gooey looking. You want to see a nice, relatively even golden across the top. It should look slightly \"crispy\" rather than slightly \"wet\". My cake took about 52 minutes to be done. Your oven may vary. Step 5: Enjoy!. <PIC> When your cake looks nice and golden and ever so slightly crispy, take it out and let it cool a little bit. This is delicious warm, room temp, or straight from the fridge as leftovers! I hope you enjoy this easy, yummy twist on a classic dump cake!

I got an idea to make a food dehydrator out of recycled parts so we could make food that is lightweight and preserves well. Dehydrated food could also come in handy in a survival situation.For this project you will need: An ice cream box (prefrerably somewhat like mine). A fan (salvaged from an old printer). A power adapter. Spray paint (optional). Let's get started! Step 1: Cut. <PIC> Take your ice cream box and place the fan on top of it. Now start drawing a line around your fan. When you are done lift the fan off and start cutting. Make sure to cut inside of your line so the fan can sit on the edges. Step 2: Spray Paint (optional). <PIC> If you want your box uniform you might want to spray paint it (I chose light grey). Start by covering the hole with cardboard and tape it down. Next take your box outside and lay it on some newspapers. Now you can start spraying it. Do a few thin coats and let it dry a bit in between. Let dry in a ventilated area. Step 3: Hot Glue. <PIC> Once the paint has cured take the box inside, you're now ready to glue the fan on the lid. This one is pretty self explanatory, just put a line of hot glue all around the hole and place your fan in it. Important: make sure that the fan is facing the right way, so it blows air into the box when it's powered. I did that mistake and tried to just switch the polarity but then the fan would not spin. Step 4: Drill. <PIC> Along the bottom of the box mark out where you are going to drill out the holes. When you are done you may proceed to drilling. You will have to scrape out the excess plastic and clean up every hole. Step 5: All Done!. <PIC> Congratulations, you have finished making your very own dehydrator.

Used mainly in French and Middle Eastern cuisines, verjuice adds a refreshing tartness without the bitterness that can be found in citrus juice or vinegar.  It has a place in anyones kitchen.   Verjuice can even be used to make a thirst quenching drink.Verjuice is typically made from unripe grapes or crabapples.  We are going to use sumac berries, which will give a beautiful red juice that can be used wherever a touch of acid is needed, whether to make vinegrettes, or deglazing pans, you will find dozens of uses for your verjuice.In the interest of full disclosure, this is rougejuice. (verjuice translates to green juice, while rouge juice translates to red juice.   Step 1: Collect Sumac Berries and Soak Them. <PIC> Warning: Do not eat any wild edibles unless you are sure of their identity.Sumac is a fairly common plant thoughtout much of the eastern and midwestern U.S.  It is a shrubby tree and easily identifies by its red berries in clusters above the foliage.  These fruit clusters are what we are after to make our verjuice.  Don't be too worried about poison sumac, for while they share a name, poison sumac has white berries, not the red ones of staghorn or smooth sumac.  Always positively identify wild foods, but sumac is one of the easier ones to identify.  You want to collect the clusters after a long dry period, as rain can wash off the acid that we are after.  Collect several bunches, leaving the large stems behind.  A few small stems are not going to hurt anything.Place your berries in a pot of lukewarm water.  Water that is hot will absorb too much tannin which makes it astringent (like overbrewed tea), while cold water takes a lot longer to collect the acid off of the berries.Rub the berries between your fingers or stir vigorously.  Let them steep in the water for 10 or 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Strain them through a colander or sieve, and collect the water.   Step 2: Strain Your Berries Out. <PIC> Collect the red water that drains off, and you have your verjuice.  The lovely red color is all natural, and you will find it refreshingly tart. Refrigerate it if you are not going to use it immediately, or freeze it in an ice cube tray for longer storage.   Use this in any way that you would otherwise use vinegar or lemon juice.  A dash on fish is better than a squeeze of lemon.  Pour a little into a pan after sauteing chicken, and you can make a delicious quick sauce.Or add simple syrup and soda water, or sugar and regular water and you have a thirst quencher that is high in vitamin C.  So go wild, you have a brand new ingredient to play with.

Here's a simple way of making layered ice-creams using LN2.Warning: LN2 is ridiculously cold (it is at its boiling point of 77 K, or nearly 200 degrees Celsius below zero) and hence is inherently dangerous. Do not try to ingest it. Make sure anyone around LN2 understands its perils (Material Safety Data Sheet). Drunks should be kept well away. Do not attempt to confine it. I strongly recommend using a thick-walled polystyrene container to hold it in while making the ice creams; definitely do NOT use a cheap glass-walled vacuum flask: there is an appreciable probability of it cracking and imploding, which trust me, is utterly indistinguishable from exploding.  Step 1: You Will Need.... <PIC> - some sort of sweet treat that can be embedded on a stick. We mostly used mini Mars bars, but jumbo marshmallows and brownies worked well too - popsicle sticks - sugar - eggs - half-and-half cream - vanilla flavoring (or whatever you happen to like) - food coloring - a few liters of liquid nitrogen (obtainable from a supplier like Praxair or Airgas, if you have a suitable container to hold it in) Step 2: Make Ice Cream Mix. <PIC> This recipe comes from a Nigella Lawson cookbook, but I don't think there is anything especially unusual about it; it's just a custard-style ice cream.

Add to a large saucepan with 500 ml of half-and-half milk/cream, and stir over moderate heat for about 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and whisk again. Add flavoring (we used a teaspoon of vanilla essence) and coloring and put in refrigerator until ready to serve. We made 2 batches of this and divided it into three jars (red, blue and uncolored cream). Step 3: Make Your Layered Ice Cream. <PIC> Push your mini Mars bar (or marshmallow, or brownie, or cake) onto a popsicle stick. and dunk into liquid nitrogen for a few seconds. Remove, and dunk the cold bar into one of the containers of liquid ice cream mix. Remove, dunk back into liquid nitrogen, and repeat as many times as you have patience for. Make funky patterns and shapes. Don't overdo the LN2 - you just need to set the ice cream, not turn it into a rock. Don't try eating it if it's fuming - it's too cold.

My dad loves a shrimp pasta dish where they mix marinara with Alfredo, so I knew he'd enjoy this too. My mom loved it as well, and I'm certain my vegetarian oldest sister will request it when she visits. The next time my sister and brother-in-law come home, I hope they can attest to its deliciousness, AFTER they help me make it! They definitely approved of the pictures, and my former-chef bro-in-law gave me some great advice on how to make it like they do in the restaurant. I searched other copycat versions, but those use jarred Alfredo, I'm OK with a lot of food in jars, Alfredo sauce is not one of them. A truly authentic Alfredo is butter and Parmesan, the version many make adds heavy cream. With salt and pepper that's 5 ingredients, not one jar of Alfredo sauce I looked at contains only 5 ingredients, so I'll go ahead and make my own, it's very easy, I promise. Even the Old Chicago menu reads:\u00a0This Old Chicago exclusive starts with spaghetti tossed in Alfredo sauce made from scratch daily with Parmesan, mozzarella, Romano and provolone cheeses, topped with even more cheeses and slow-baked to toasty perfection. Served by the slice over our house marinara.\u00a0 There are a few steps to this recipe, but they can all be done around, or at the same time, with a little multi-tasking. I will say you can use a good-quality jarred marinara, but the recipe I use, from Cook's Illustrated,\u00a0can be made in less than an hour, and tastes as if it's been cooking all day.\u00a0 I made a roux-based Alfredo, thick enough to coat the pasta and not separate when baked. Reserving a bit for a creamy top, made slightly gooey with a top layer of cheese. Some of the edges of the spaghetti get slightly crunchy (my favorite bits). With each bite you get rich creamy spaghetti Alfredo brightened up with the marinara. Some garlic bread and a side salad are all you need for a perfect meal. \u00a0 My dad and I really love Arrabbiata, or zesty marinara, sauce, I believe you could use that as a base for some nice heat if you love spicy foods too. \u00a0 Please enjoy this spaghetti pie as soon as possible so you can have an \"Oh my\" eating experience too!\u00a0 \u00a0 Serves 8\u00a0 Marinara recipe from Cook's Illustrated, March 2006 Step 1: Gather Ingredients. <PIC> You'll need: One 9 1/2- to 10-inch deep dish pie plate, sprayed with non-stick spray For the Alfredo pie: 1/4 cup unsalted butter 1/4 cup all purpose flour 2 cups whole milk 1 cup heavy cream Pinch ground nutmeg 2 cups Italian Five Cheese blend shredded cheese (I used Kraft Italian), divided 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided \u00a0 Salt and pepper, to taste 12 oz. spaghetti For the marinara: 2 (28 ounce) cans whole tomatoes, packed in juice 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped fine (about 1 cup) 2 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons) 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano (since I forgot the basil, I used 1 teaspoon pasta seasoning mix instead of just oregano) 1/3 cup dry red wine (I used Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot would also work) 3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil (I unfortunately forgot to buy this)\u00a0 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil Salt and ground black pepper 1 - 2 teaspoons sugar, as needed\u00a0 Step 2: Make Alfredo Sauce. <PIC> Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. (I also preheat a baking sheet on the rack, as I bake all my pies on baking sheets to contain any spills.)\u00a0 Remove 1/2 cup shredded Italian five cheese from the bag, and add to a small bowl mixing it with 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan, set aside for topping the partially baked pie. You'll use the remaining 1 1/2 cups plus 1/2 cup Parmesan for the Alfredo sauce.\u00a0 Combine heavy cream and milk in one measuring cup. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until foaming, whisk in flour until combined, continue whisking until mixture is smooth and slightly golden, about 1 minute. Gradually add milk and heavy cream, increase heat to medium-high and whisk constantly to combine into a smooth sauce. Bring mixture just to a boil, turn heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a pinch of nutmeg during this time.\u00a0 Once sauce is thickened, start adding the cheese, a handful at a time, stirring after each addition waiting until the cheese is melted before adding more. Continue adding, and stirring, until the 2 cups of cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed, you may only need some pepper since the cheese is somewhat salty.\u00a0 Turn heat off but leave pan on burner, cover, and keep warm until ready to toss with spaghetti.\u00a0 Step 3: Make Marinara Sauce. <PIC> Cook pasta and begin baking pie while marinara cooks. Note: I actually halved this recipe, that was a mistake because it tasted so good with the pie, and garlic bread, we wished there was more.\u00a0 Pour tomatoes and juice into strainer set over large bowl. Open tomatoes with hands and remove and discard fibrous cores; let tomatoes drain excess liquid, about 5 minutes. Remove 3/4 cup tomatoes from strainer and set aside. Reserve 2 1/2 cups tomato\u00a0juice and discard remainder. Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and\u00a0golden around edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes from strainer and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring every minute, until liquid has evaporated and tomatoes begin to stick to bottom of pan and brown fond forms around pan edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Add wine and cook until thick and syrupy, about 1 minute. Add reserved tomato juice and bring to simmer; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally\u00a0and loosening browned bits, until sauce is thick, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer sauce to food processor (or transfer to saucepan and insert immersion blender; and add reserved tomatoes; process until slightly chunky, about eight 2-second pulses (you can make it as thick or as smooth as you like). Return sauce to\u00a0skillet and add basil and extra-virgin olive oil and salt, pepper, and sugar (I added 1 tsp.) to taste. Step 4: Cook Pasta, Assemble, and Bake Spaghetti Pie. <PIC> As you start making the marinara, bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon salt then spaghetti, stirring occasionally to separate the strands. Cook until al dente (even slightly firmer than al dente since it will soften more as it bakes). I reserved 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water just in case I needed to thin the alfredo sauce (in the end I didn't, but save the water just in case). Drain the pasta and return to the pot. Stir the Alfredo sauce again to make sure it's smooth, then add all but 1 cup to the spaghetti and toss to combine. Return the cover to the Alfredo and keep it warm (my oven has a warming burner, if you don't, warm it gently over low heat before topping the partially baked pie with it.) If you feel the sauce is too thick and not coating all of the pasta easily you can add some of the pasta cooking water, a little at a time, until the sauce is thoroughly mixed with the pasta. Transfer the spaghetti to the pie dish and pat down the top to make an even layer. Bake for 20 minutes.\u00a0 Step 5: Finish the Pie, Let Cool Slightly, and Serve With Marinara Sauce. <PIC> After 20 minutes, remove the pie from the oven. Re-stir the Alfredo sauce so it's once again smooth, top the pie with the remaining Alfredo using a spatula to spread over the entire pie.\u00a0 Sprinkle the remaining 3/4 cup cheese on top of the Alfredo sauce, return to oven for 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and light golden brown. Rotate your baking sheet front to back halfway through baking. Remove from oven and let pie rest 10 minutes. Spread a layer of marinara sauce on each serving plate, or shallow bowl, cut pie into pieces and serve on top of marinara. (If I had some fresh basil I would've loved to sprinkle some finely chopped over the top of each dish.) Serve, garlic bread on the side is wonderful for scooping up excess sauce, enjoy!\u00a0 Leftovers can be stored, covered, keeping the marinara separate, for 3 days. The pie itself reheats well in a toaster oven. I microwaved the marinara sauce while warming the pie. (I'm not sure if reheating the entire dish in the microwave would work well, the pasta might get too dry, but you could try it if you have leftovers and no toaster oven.)", "images_list": ["oh-my-spaghetti-pie-an-old-chicago-copycat_0", "oh-my-spaghetti-pie-an-old-chicago-copycat_1", "oh-my-spaghetti-pie-an-old-chicago-copycat_2", "oh-my-spaghetti-pie-an-old-chicago-copycat_3", "oh-my-spaghetti-pie-an-old-chicago-copycat_4", "oh-my-spaghetti-pie-an-old-chicago-copycat_5"]}

Step 1: Gather Your Goods. <PIC> For this recipe I used:4 cups of fresh water1/2 cup goji berries1/8 cup hibiscus petal1/8 cup rose petal1 tsp schisandra berries1 tbsp. honeylemon, for garnish and a splash of juice to add some acidityFor the tools I used: various measuring cups and spoonsa pota strainera funnelan empty, clean, and sterilized glass bottle Step 2: Some Notes on the Ingredients. Disclaimer: Skip this step if you just want a tasty beverage and not be put to sleep due to boredom. Oh and I am not doctor and this is just what I have read on the subject of the ingredients. It is not advisable to consume this beverage if you are pregnant or nursing, I've read. The main ingredient here is the Goji berry. It is believed that goji helps your kidneys and liver function by tonifying the blood. They contain antioxidants, like beta-carotene and zeaxanthin, and long chain sugars called Lycium barbarum polysaccharides. These supposedly aid the immune system by increasing production of superoxide dismutase, or SOD. Great...what does that mean?Free radicals such as superoxide, O2(-), and Hydrxyl, OH(-), can cause cell damage and trust me, you don't want that. So the SOD turns the O2(-) into regular oxygen, O2,  which is good, and/or hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which is more easily removable from the body. Schisandra is a berry that in Chinese medicine is said to help skin and aid in beautification. It also is believed to aid in fatigue and circulation. Additionally, it is believed to help cleanse the liver. Hibiscus/Rose petals will reinforce that deep red color of the beverage and add nice floral notes.  Step 3: Let's Make. <PIC> Bring your water to a boilRemove from the heatAdd all ingredients except the honey Let sit for 1 hourStrain and discard solidsYou really do not want to push on the solids because the schisandra may be a bit tanic.

Most of the plans for an outdoor kitchen area I was able to find online were made up of wood and steel, and I wanted to try something new. First we drew the plan (as seen in the pictures). We then started with digging the marked area and then poured concrete in there. We then used concrete cinder blocks to build the walls. This was ultimately followed by tiling and grouting.

Items needed: Sand Cement blocks (total number depends on how many and how high do you want the walls) Cement/concrete mix Tiles Mortar Grout A small counter grill, a large gas grill and a smoker Specifics: The digging was followed by mixing the concrete bags - we had to use about 35 of the 80lb bags. We waited for a few days to let the area completely dry. We then put concrete blocks according to the counter space we needed, and to make sure that the smoker and the gas grill fit as well.

Step 1: Write the Letters. <PIC> I used regular pancake batter, but thickening it up a tiny bit would probably be helpful- not too much because you won't be able to get good detail if it is too thick, but if it is particularly thin you won't be able to get finer lines- they will just run everywhere.  The first thing that I did wrong was to make the lettering face right side up, when in fact it needs to be mirrored so that when you flip the pancakes over and it gets reversed the names or initial or whatever you do with them are readable to the eater.  So, pour the name onto your heated griddle mirrored.  Another thing that I did slightly differently as I went on was to let the letters cook a little bit first, a good 30 seconds or a minute before going to the next step.\u00a0 Step 2: Finishing Up. <PIC> \u00a0After the letters have cooked a minute, go ahead and pour batter over and around them so that all the letters of the name are encased.  You could, of course, just cook the letters by themselves, but I figured the name in a pancake was kind of cool.  Then you flip the pancake as normal, but because you will probably end up with an awkward size or shape, it will be more difficult than a regular round pancake.  One I ended up using two spatulas simultaneously to flip, which was a challenge but (to me) was well worth it for the coolness factor. These were made for Caleb, AJ, Alex and Ben.\nHave fun and make your kids feel loved in a yummy way to start the day!

Living in Hawaii I grew up with lilikoi butter as a staple in our home. It was always in the fridge ready to be topped on whatever my heart desired. It was only after moving to the mainland that I realized that most people have no clue what it is. And boy are you all missing out!Lilikoi is more commonly known as passion fruit. This is however nothing like a fruit butter which does not contain any butter at all. Although called Lilikoi butter it is actually a curd made with Passion fruit juice, butter, sugar, and eggs.  Very simple to make and it keeps well in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks.Once you try it on toast, pancakes, or crepes you will wonder why you never heard of it before! Step 1: Gather You Ingredients. 1/2 Cup passion fruit juice2/3 Cup sugar (Add more to taste)3 Eggs6 Tablespoons Butter You will need a sauce pan and glass bowl for a double boiler. A whisk and a strainer.Here is a great video on how to juice lilikoi.Finding fresh passion fruit isn't very easy to do so frozen pulp or puree is your next best bet. Juice concentrate will also work. This Goya brand can be found in Hispanic markets which is what I used. You might also find different brands that will say Parcha or Maracuja which means passion fruit. I found this on amazon but it is spendy. If you do get your hands on fresh lilikoi, cut them in half and scoop everything into a food processor and pulse for a couple seconds. Pour over a sieve and press down on the seeds the extract as much of the juice as possible. It will take about 5-8 lilikoi for 1/2 cup of juice. Discard the seeds. Step 2: Cooking Directions. Fill your pot with an inch of water, bring to a simmer.First you will pour the eggs, sugar and juice in a glass bowl and whisk until combined. Then cut the butter into cubes and add to the other ingredientsPlace the bowl onto the pot with the simmering water. Stir consistently until the liquid thickens. You will know it's done when the butter coats the back of a spoon. Strain the butter to make sure you get a smooth creamy consistency. Place plastic wrap directly on top of the butter to prevent a skin from forming.Let cool, then refrigerate.*There are other ways to make curds but the double boiler helps prevent the eggs from scrambling. Another option is to place all the ingredients except for the eggs into a sauce pan and heat, then add some of the heated liquid to the eggs to temper them, then pour it all back into the sauce pan and stir until thickened.  Step 3: Lilikoi Butter Uses. Here are some of the amazing ways to use Lilikoi Butter:Spread on toast'Syrup' for pancakes or crepesFrosting on cake top Filling for donutsTartsParfaitsThe options are endless. Lilikoi is a great substitute for lemon recipes. Lilikoi lemon bars, Lilikoi meringue pie, etc. It is such a fun and delicious way to switch things up. Not to mention it also makes the perfect homemade holiday present. Pour in a sanitized mason jar and decorate to your liking. :)", "images_list": []}

{"id": "RECIPE_1348", "question": "What is the best way to craft a wine spike that elegantly holds both wine glasses and bottles?", "provenance": [40865], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Easy Build Wine Spike. <PIC> Summer is for catching up with friends, old and new, over some home cooked food and good wine . . . .I don't know about you but as the hours pass and numbers dwindle I always end up settled down in some comfy garden chair chatting. At the end of my first glass of vino I then go in search of more vino and a wine spike.The wine spike is a \"holder\" that I dreamt up one afternoon when I realised that I had poured far too much wine into the lawn. It can hold a glass of wine securely along the bottle of wine (my favourite) or just glasses or wine.  Step 1: Materials. <PIC> I love projects that are simple so this one especially strikes a cord. The only thing you need is a board that is approximately 1000mm long by 100mm wide. Thickness is whatever you have, be it 10mm or 25mm, all will work.Ultimately you need to have 3 pieces of wood approximately the following lengths, the same width and ideally the same thickness but it not this is not the end of the world :-)Upright approximately 400mm longBottom support approximately 150mm longTop support approximately 200mm long Step 2: Wine Bottle Holder. <PIC> As part of the research into this project I did intensive testing of wine bottles and their contents. The benefit was that when I came to cutting the hole to retain the wine bottle I was fully aware of size variations and knew that a 90mm diameter hole would be good for most bottles.So I loaded an appropriately sized cutter into my pillar drill, clamped the wood securely to the stand and started to cut the hole. Hole cutters have a central drill bit that helps align the cutter and this means that when you have drilled down 3/4 of the distance you can flip the wood over and complete the cut. The benefit of this is that you reduce the amount of splintering or breakout that occurs on the surface. Step 3: Cutting the Joints. <PIC> The wood I have used for this build is a 1 metre piece of oak board left over from another project. The benefit of this is that the width and thickness are going to be consistent along the whole board.This means that it is an ideal project to use half lap joints on. A half lap joint is one where you remove half the material each of the two pieces of wood that you wish to cross over.So the starting point is to get the width of the wood, halve it and add a little bit back on  :-)  So for my project the width of the wood was 98mm. Half of that is 49mm and I added an extra 2mm back on to ensure that when the join comes together the edges of the wood are nice and flush with each other. I will be cutting out 51mm of material in each half of the joint.To cut the joints by hand you would mark out where you want it on the wood and use a tenon saw to remove the bulk of the material before cleaning and final sizing with a sharp chisel.I am fortunate enough to have a table saw so I will be using this to make the joints because it is nice and quick. The table saw method involved adjusting the height of the blade so that is protrudes 51mm. With the mitre gauge set to cut 90 degrees to the blade, the wood is run over the blade, returned to its original position and moved along so that the next pass removes the next bit of wood. I repeat this until all but a very small slither of wood remains to be removed. I can then test to see if the wood slides over the other piece and know how much I need to remove to make a nice snug fit.Two halving joints are required on the upright and one each in the middle of the remaining two pieces. Step 4: Wine Glass Holder. <PIC> The top of the wine spike at this point has the large hole for the wine bottle and the housing joint.By replacing the wooden disc cut out previously you can work out the distance from the centre of the hole to the side of the joint. This is the distance from the other side of the joint where you will create the wine glass holder hole.So the hole cutter is replaced by a forstner bit in the pillar drill and the hole is started to be drilled out. Before you go all the way though you need to take a perpendicular line from the centre point to the side of the wood. This is where you will be making a break in the wood that the wine glass stem will pass through.When the hole is finally cut all the way through, I took the wood and run it through the table saw a couple more time to create the break. Step 5: Finishing Touches. <PIC> Just a couple of small finishing touches needed now; all pieces were given a light sanding and the bottom of the upright was trimmed to create a spike that will go into the ground. A bit of oil wiped over the wood and it is complete.Slot the 3 pieces together, stick it in your lawn and you are ready to go . . . . Variations of this would be :make it as a double wine glass holder with no bottle make it single sidedround over all the edges", "images_list": ["easy-build-wine-spike_0", "easy-build-wine-spike_1", "easy-build-wine-spike_2", "easy-build-wine-spike_3", "easy-build-wine-spike_4", "easy-build-wine-spike_5"]}

A close relative of the Corn and Onion Frittata. Step 1: Theory. <PIC> Why a frittata and not a regular omelet or scrambled eggs?  And what's the difference, anyway?An open-faced omelet with other ingredients, such as cheese or vegetables, mixed into the eggs rather than used as a filling.  (Thank you, American Heritage Dictionary.)I am NOT a morning person, but really like to eat a good breakfast.  To qualify, said breakfast must contain lean protein, some veggies, not much fat, and lots of flavor; it must also keep me mostly full and occupied until lunch.  Managing to hit all of these things was rather hard until Eric figured out a system.   We prefer different things in our frittatas, but the basic technique remains the same.  Pan Selection:  first, find yourself a nice stainless steel omelet pan.  Nonstick pans contain teflon, and you've probably heard lots of reallyscarythings about teflon; while the jury is still out on exactly how bad teflon is for you, I'm avoiding it when there are other nice easy options.  Additionally, nonstick pans shouldn't be put under the broiler, so you're still better of going with the stainless pan.  You can usually find an 8\" All Clad stainless omelet/fry pan for sale for $19.99 somewhere on the internet, and it will last forever.  The low-heat slow cooking we use here prevents the eggs from sticking to the stainless pan, otherwise a common problem when cooking eggs.Timing:  we're going to start everything cooking on VERY LOW, then run off for a shower.  This gives you a large window; you can leave the eggs for anything between 15-30 minutes.  This should be plenty of  time for a leisurely shower, whatever primping you require, and even some clothes before returning to give breakfast a 2-minute hit under the broiler.  This translates to ~3 minutes of chopping and/or dumping on the front end, and another quick transfer just before eating.  Even in my sleep-deprived pre-shower state I can usually manage this, though I will thoroughly recommend hooking up with a nice morning person who is willing to start breakfast for you.Alternatively, just add a scoop of whatever leftovers you've got in the fridge.  I've used chopped up bits of leftover meat, veggies, stews, curries, whatever - most anything tastes good with eggs. Step 2: Prepare Frittata Ingredients. <PIC> Assemble the following ingredients:stainless omelet pancanola oil (regular or spray)roasted tomatoesbasilchopped garlic (fresh or roasted with the tomatoes)optional:  red onion, thinly slicedegg whites (in a carton or freshly separated)optional toppings:  parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepperSet the empty pan on the stove, turned on as low as it goes, and leave it alone for a minute while you chop your tomatoes, basil, and garlic.  A couple of whacks will do; this isn't the French Laundry or anything nearly so fancy or complicated.  Think fresh, rustic food, and give the bits a few machete-like whacks with your big chef's knife.   If you fear for your fingers in your sleep-deprived state, prep your ingredients the night before or earlier in the week and stay away from the knives until you've had your shower/coffee/etc. Step 3: Start Cooking. <PIC> By now the pan should be getting warm.  Spray it with the canola oil, and drop the tomatoes, basil, onions, and garlic in.  Spread them evenly around the bottom of the pan.  If there's loud sizzling you'll need to turn the heat down farther.  Really, I mean it:  turn it as low as it will go.\nPour in the egg whites, at least enough to fully cover the bottom.  The more you add the thicker your frittata will be; experiment a bit to see what you like.  (Note that the \"Real Egg Product- 99% Egg\" sounds a bit scary; the other 1% is vegetable gums for consistency, and beta carotene to mimic the color of whole eggs.  We prefer to get the 100% pure egg whites, but not all stores carry them and they may be more expensive.  Stay the heck away from Egg Beaters; read the label.)\nGrind pepper over the top, and sprinkle with parmesan if you're using it.\nWalk away for a while.  Take a shower, check your email, make your coffee; do whatever you need to become a functional human being again.  After you've seen this cook once, you'll believe me and go have your shower without fear of burned breakfast.  Come back somewhere between 15-30 minutes later.  Note that the thicker you make your frittata the more time you'll have to mess with. Step 4: Broil. <PIC> Now that you're properly awake, come back and check the frittata.  Rotate the pan around to test.  Is the middle cooked through?  Are there still runny bits on top, or is the top solid?  If the middle is cooked through, you're good to go.  Solid or runny tops will both finish just fine under the broiler.\nSo:  put your oven rack on the highest shelf, and turn the broiler on.  Remember to turn the stove off.  (Not that I've ever forgotten...)\nStick the pan directly under the broiler.  Keep an eye on it, because this goes fast and you can easily end up with a blackened frittata.  \nRemove the pan when the top looks properly golden-brown. Step 5: Serve and Eat. <PIC> Grab a spatula (one of those silicone ones works nicely) and scoot the frittata out onto a plate.  If the heat was low enough, you shouldn't see anything sticking to the bottom of the pan.  The smeary stuff you see here rinses off easily.Arrange your frittata more artfully than I have.  Bits of basil would make it look far classier.If you've got a balsamic reduction around, squirt some  over/around the frittata to provide a sweet/savory counterpoint to the flavor of juxtaposition of essence...blahblahblah.  Balsamic, particularly reduced balsamic, makes everything taste good.  It's particularly effective if there are tomatoes involved. I'll put up an instructable on this when Trader Joe's gets their cheap balsamic back in stock.

{"id": "RECIPE_1367", "question": "What is the process for creating flavorful old-fashioned fermented garlic dill pickles from scratch?", "provenance": [40876], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Old Fashioned Fermented Garlic Dill Pickles. <PIC> Old Fashioned Fermented Garlic Dill Pickles use no vinegar. The fermentation produces lactic acid, naturally. This process for pickle making requires maintaining the pickle barrel, crock, plastic bucket or food grade container of your choice at approximately 85\u00b0 Fahrenheit for 6 weeks. I do this by putting the container in the oven and leaving the oven light on. One of the most unusual aspects of this recipe is the ability to add more spices after the initial fermentation. My latest batch, originally had 2 heads of garlic. After 2 weeks in process, a sample taste lacked sufficient garlic and dill flavor. More was added and a week later another sample taste showed those flavors sufficient. Most of the recipes for garlic dill pickles on the 'net use vinegar. While vinegar won't make bad pickles, in does change the flavor. I like my old fashioned fermented best so, I'm giving you my way.   If after the 6 weeks of aging (like fine wine, only much faster) you want to keep your pickles, strain the brine of all solids. Boil it up, allow it to cool to room temperature. Fill you pickle jars with pickles and top over with brine. Heat can those as for any pickle. Genuine dills do not keep well. That isn't to say the go bad. What does happen is they lose their flavor first, and then some texture (goes soft). I never can keep them once made, so for me, that has never been a problem. I don't profess to have my spice profile perfected. It's still a work in progress because I only buy cucumbers when the price goes to 3 pound for $1.00 (US Dollar). I give you the spices and herbs I use in this recipe. One last point: for every gallon of water use no more than 4 ounces of salt. I weigh this amount on a scale. Please don't try measuring by volume, using, for example: Morton's Kosher Salt and expect to get 4 ounces of salt. Not happening! For those interested this is about a 20\u00b0 strength brine. I see a lot of dill pickle recipes that call for either fresh or dried ginger. It's not a flavor I like in dill, so I use horseradish. I believe that as the Germans, English and Scandinavians developed their pickle recipes over the years that horseradish would have been a readily available ingredient compared with fresh ginger. Anyway, I use horseradish, cutting the bulb on a mandolin to make thin rounds.6-July-2014 - a small addition. If you are selecting cucumbers, or harvesting them from a garden or farm, leave the stem about \u215b\" to \u00bc\" long. Once pickled, those long-ish stems may be removed. For 4 gallons of water, 16 oz. of mixed, dried pickling spice is sufficient. This does not include the weight of the fresh dill. The dill (which I cannot buy at markets in Southern California), should have the seed heads in bloom, but the seeds not yet dropping. That is the best dill. I've added the source of this information as the last URL in the list below. I think that the given quantity of 1 oz. of pickling spice per gallon of water is too little. I use about 4 ozs. of spice per gallon of water. I like a highly flavored pickle. YMMV. whole cinnamon sticks mustard seeds - any color coriander seeds - increasingly being denominated: cilantro seeds allspice - whole black pepper - whole dill seeds - whole - optional, I use more fresh dill - sometimes called dill weed - at today's prices it's not priced like a weed fennel seeds - whole cloves - whole mace - blades (same as whole) celery seeds bay leaves hot chile pepper whole horseradish - the secret ingredient garlic - fresh dill - in bunches If you have an interest in how professional pickle makers made their pickles about 100 years ago, along with some spice profiles and other tips, you can read my technical post atOld Fashioned Fermented Garlic Dill Pickles There the science of pickle making is revealed.

This recipe is for 8 apples. Ingredients: \u00a0\u00a0 - 8 somewhat tart cooking apples, cored, but not peeled \u00a0\u00a0 - 1 (14 to 15 ounce) package of refrigerated pie crusts (packed two to a package) \u00a0\u00a0 - 1/2 cup light brown sugar \u00a0\u00a0 - 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon \u00a0\u00a0 - 1/3 cup chopped walnuts \u00a0\u00a0 - 1/3 cup raisins \u00a0\u00a0 - 1/3 cup oatmeal (rolled oats) \u00a0\u00a0 - 8 pats (4 Tablespoons) butter or margarine \u00a0\u00a0 - ~24 toothpicks Preparation: \u00a0\u00a0 1. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. \u00a0\u00a0 2. Mix brown sugar, walnuts, raisins, rolled oats, and cinnamon together, in a bowl. \u00a0\u00a0 3. Cut both pie crusts into quarters (= 8 pieces). Place 1 apple in center of each quarter-circle. Using a small spoon, fill apple cores with brown sugar mixture and tamp down as needed. It\u2019s okay to let excess spill over onto the open pie crust. \u00a0\u00a0 4. Lift up the three corners of the pie crust, skillfully forming around the apple with your hands, inserting a toothpick into each corner of the pie crust. Insert toothpicks only halfway, as all of them will need to be carefully removed, prior to serving. The apples will only be partially covered by the \u00bc pie crust, and will not at all look neat and tidy, but that will ultimately prove to give each finished apple a unique, rustic, and yummy appearance. \u00a0\u00a0 5. Arrange apples on a 13\u201d x 9\u201d cookie sheet, and top each apple with a pat (1/2 Tablespoon) of butter or margarine. \u00a0\u00a0 6. Bake at 400\u00b0F for 35 minutes, until the crusts are light to medium brown. Camping Option: Bake in a 14-inch diameter cast iron dutch oven. Arrange 40 red-hot charcoal briquettes in a circle on the lid, carefully positioned next to the raised edge of the rim, and 17 red-hot charcoal briquettes underneath, carefully arranged in a circle, positioned just under the round edge of the oven. Bake for about 35 minutes, checking occasionally. Boy Scout / Trail Life USA Option: Wrap each finished (cored, filled, and with a pat of butter top and bottom) apple with one layer of aluminum foil, shiny side out. Next, wrap again with another layer of aluminum foil, shiny side out. To produce an essential layer of trapped air between the two layers of aluminum foil, wrap the second layer of foil from the opposite side of the foil-wrapped apple, so that the wrinkled, thicker part of the foil wrapping surrounds the entire apple and prevents burned spots. Set the foil-wrapped apples over a bed of hot coals/charcoal, tumbling frequently with tongs, for about 20 to 30 minutes until done. \"Shiny side out\" foil wrapping will make the cooking more of an even-baked and controlled process. When done, remove and discard outer foil layer and serve. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 We've tried topping these baked apples with whipped cream, or vanilla ice cream, but don't recommend it, as it really seems to detract from the elegant simplicity of this tasty breakfast treat.", "images_list": ["baked-apple-dumplings-quick-easy_0"]}

Being chronically ill, I get energy from the food I consume, and I already know that sugars do very little to help get me moving, but you can probably tell from the majority of my Instructables, I do enjoy my desserts. Katie Higgin's cookbook truly does let you have your cake, brownies, pie, and eat them too. She's found a way to make almost everyone's favorite desserts vegan, low sugar, calorie friendly, and somewhat healthy, while still maintaining tremendous flavor. You can visit her blog Chocolate Covered Katie, which gets as many rave reviews as her cookbook.The first time I read her recipe for this Lemon Meltaway Pie, it sounded so outlandish I had to try it! The main filling components are cashews and cauliflower, let me say that again, cashews and cauliflower! As most things lemon appeal to me, I figured there was enough juice called for that the flavor would stand out. This pie is no bake, low sugar, and took me less than an hour to make as the crust comes together in a food processor, and the filling in a high speed blender. It does require the easy advance prep of soaking the cashews 6 to 8 hours (I soaked mine overnight), and thawing frozen cauliflower (thawed in a bowl in my refrigerator overnight). The crust is made of ground oats and coconut, a bit of brown sugar and salt bringing out both flavors for a nutty, crunchy crust that tastes like bits of a great granola. Using coconut oil in the crust and filling gives the pie a slightly tropical feel. I decided to add a topping of whipped coconut cream, further complimenting the existing coconut flavor. Using fresh lemon juice brings a welcome burst of flavor and almost cheesecake-like texture is obtained when the ingredients all come together and the pie is chilled. As we (finally!) turn the corner from winter into spring this Pi(e) day, eating this pie is akin to sitting on a comfy beach chair, basking in the sunlight, looking out at the Caribbean. The best part might be that you can eat plenty of this pie and still look forward to bathing suit season as you watch the snow melt. And a special delight is reserved for whomever makes it, when they reveal the secret ingredients to this dreamy lemon pie! Happy Pi(e) day, enjoy! Serves 8Recipe adapted from, and reprinted with permission: Credit: Chocolate Covered Katie by Katie Higgins (Grand Central Life & Style; copyright 2015) Step 1: Gather Ingredients. <PIC> For the crust:1 cup rolled oats 1/2 cup shredded unsweetened coconut1/4 cup melted coconut oil, or vegetable oil2 tablespoons light brown sugar1/4 teaspoon saltFor the filling:1 cup raw cashews or macadamia nuts, soaked (to prepare: cover nuts with water and soak for 6 to 8 hours, drain before using.)2 cups loosely packed frozen cauliflower, thawed completely1/3 cup melted virgin coconut oil1/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp. lemon juice1 tablespoon vanilla extract4-6 tablespoons maple, or agave, syrup (I used Trader Joe's Maple Agave Syrup Blend)1/4 teaspoon saltFor whipped coconut cream:Half can of coconut cream, or full can of coconut milk, refrigerated overnight, liquid discarded1/4 cup confectioner's (powdered) sugar, more or less to taste1/2 tsp. vanilla extract Step 2: Prepare Crust. <PIC> Grease a 9-inch pie plate with nonstick spray. Combine rolled oats, coconut, light brown sugar, and salt in a food processor; process until fine crumbs form, drizzle coconut oil over top, pulse until combined. Press dough into prepared pan in an even layer, pressing up along sides.Freeze while preparing the filling.  Step 3: Prepare Filling. <PIC> Drain nuts completely. Combine nuts and filling ingredients in a high powered blender, or food processor; process until completely smooth, adding liquid as needed until the filling is smooth (I started with 4 Tbsp. maple agave syrup, and needed to add 1 more Tbsp. plus 1 Tbsp. water to loosen the filling enough to easily rotate around the blades). Transfer filling to prepared pie crust and freeze until firm, at least 3 hours.(I have only tested this recipe using my high speed Vitamix, I can't be certain you'd achieve a smooth filling using anything less powerful.) Step 4: \u200bPrepare Coconut Whipped Cream. <PIC> If your kitchen is warm, I recommend freezing your bowl and whisk for 15 minutes before whipping to help the cream stay cold. Spoon only the solidified coconut cream from the can into the mixing bowl, as I used Trader Joe's Coconut Cream which has little liquid, I only used half the can, which yielded enough for my family, you can use the full can if you love whipped cream.Start whipping using the whisk attachment on a stand mixer, hand beaters, or, if you're quick, a regular whisk, and increase the speed to medium, whisk for 30 seconds than add in vanilla extract and powdered sugar to taste. I find sugar brings out the coconut flavor, which complimented this pie, you don't have to add any, or you can use more. Increase the speed to medium high and whisk until cloud-like and fluffy, about two minutes. Again, whip to your preference, soft or firmer peaks. The whipped coconut cream will thicken as it chills, if you make it ahead, you may prefer to whisk again before serving. As you can see, I used the whipped coconut cream as decoration for Pi(e) day and saved the rest for people to serve themselves. After freezing the pie 3 hours, I covered it with plastic wrap, and transferred the pie to my refrigerator, we enjoyed it the next day. If serving from frozen, I'd let it thaw about half an hour at room temperature so the filling is custardy again.Spoon whipped coconut cream over pie before serving, delight in the reactions of your loved ones when you tell them this delicious lemon pie was made using cashews and cauliflower! Happy Pi(e) Day, enjoy! Leftovers can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to three days.

Later on they buried a bread loaf in this shape instead of their hair. This bread has been known in Switzerland since the middle of the 15th Century.\nWe like to eat late on Sundays and have a Brunch instead of breakfast. Most often my people scream for a Zopf....

The fresh yeast can be dissolved with a little sugar. Add this to the flour and then add the rest of the warm milk.\nMix this all together and knead to an elastic dough.

It was a simple and delicious way to celebrate the holiday!\nAll you need is:\nA candy mold: I suggest a silicone ice cube tray\nChocolate Chips: The better the chips, the better the chocolates\nAdditions to the chocolates: Marshmallows, potato chips, chili powder if its dark chocolate, crushed almonds, peanut butter, coconut shavings, cereal such as rice crispies, another kind of chocolate, jelly etc.\nToppings for the chocolates: Sprinkles, smaller candies, nuts, or cocoa powder Step 1: Melting the Chocolate. <PIC> Double boiler: If you don't have one of these I suggest:\n1) Fill up a saucepan with about 2 inches or more of water.\n2) Put a metal mixing bowl on top of the saucepan but do not allow the water to touch the bowl.\n3) Next put the chocolate chips in the mixing bowl and mix constantly, do not allow the chocolate to burn.\nIn a microwave:\n1) Use a microwave safe bowl for this part\n2) Add one layer of chocolate chips of your choosing to the bowl and microwave for 30 second increments. Mix after each session to see if it is fluid.\n3) After each microwaving session, mix the chips, sometimes they will just melt when exposed to a different part of the bowl.\n* Every microwave works differently but the melting process will vary so this may take a few tries before perfection.

If worst comes to worst, you can eat the misfits :) Step 3: Toppings!. <PIC> \nBe creative! Add whatever you want to the top of your chocolates\nSprinkles, nuts, candy covered chocolates, etc.\nYou can foreshadow what kind of flavor the chocolate will be by adding different toppings for different chocolate types.\nYou can fill up a quart size plastic bag with some melted chocolate and then cut a hole in one of the corners to create a patter on top of your chocolate like, zigzags, hatched marks, polka dots, and anything you can think of, you can even spell something out with multiple chocolates\n*** Do not refrigerate or freeze your chocolates!!

I have tried a few different recipes and have enjoyed them, but decided to come up with a new edition after analyzing the ingredients in several top recipes (see spreadsheet). Most of the other family members are not eggnog fans (yet) so for now there is more for me! My method is based mostly off of the one found on www.thekitchn.com and they describe the benefits of aging your nog for a few days or longer pretty well. They also stick with the basics as far as ingredients. So let's do it! By the way, it does not have any pineapple or tangerine in it, those were just festive staging touches.  Step 1: Getting Ready . <PIC> Get the ingredients that you will need together: what's great is they are mostly staples that you may already have. As you can see, this is the bottom shelf, slightly lighter version. Feel free to class it up with high end bourbon, richer cream, etc. I want mine to fit into two 750 ml bottles so that is how I chose my amounts. 6 eggs - separated 1 cup sugar 2 cups milk 1 cup half and half 1 cup bourbon  Step 2: Mix It Up . <PIC> Add the egg yolks to a bowl and combine with sugar using a whisk until fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Reserve the egg whites in a separate jar until serving. Add in milk and cream and whisk to dissolve the sugar. Lastly, add the bourbon to the mix and whisk it in. Then pour the nog into your bottles.  Step 3: Set It Aside . <PIC> Putting the eggnog on the shelf in the fridge for a few days will let the flavors meld and give it a slightly thicker texture. In addition, you now have a fully prepared concoction ready to go when you want it. If you plan on aging for more than one day, freezing the egg whites is a good idea. The alcohol in the mixture acts as a preservative and also makes the raw eggs much safer. However, if you are vulnerable (young, old, pregnant or sick) find a recipe that has cooked eggs. Alternatively, the alcohol can be omitted for merrymakers of all ages, but it should not be aged in that case.  Step 4: Make Merry! . <PIC> To serve, thaw then whip the egg whites and fold them in with the bottled eggnog. Pour into cocktail glasses or whatever festive vessels you have on hand (think moose antler glasses from Christmas Vacation). Nutmeg is traditionally used as a garnish for eggnog, dusted on top, and it really adds a very nice aroma and taste, not to mention appearance! Happy Holidays!

Here is a list. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. Arduino Board \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. AD620 In-Amp \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3. WH-B05 Scale from Amazon \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4.

XBee Modules (Needed for wireless communication, but not required) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9. Normaly Open Push Button (For taring, or zeroing out the scale) I want to stay away from a wire by wire description of all of the connections. I will go into a bunch of detail and explain some of the less obvious connections. Feel free to contact me if you have any specific questions. I'd be happy to answer them. Ok, here we go... Lets start left to right on the circuit board. For a bigger image, go to the pics page. The first chip is the AD620. Across pins one and eight are two 56 ohm resistors in parallel, giving us 28 ohms. If you look at the data sheet, that gives us close to a gain of 10,000. Seems to work for me, you may need to vary a bit. Pin 4 is -5V coming from the ICL7660. Look at the data sheet for cap values (10uF) and get your V(in) from the regulated 5V from the Arduino. Pin 7 of the AD620 is 5V. Pin 6, the output, the all IMPORTANT output! Notice the resistor and cap? This is our RC filter that smoothes the output. Without it the values jump all over the place. I you put the wire to the Arduino analog input in between the resistor and the cap, we get an ALMOST perfectly steady value. I used a 1K resistor and a 100uF cap. I played with the cap value a lot and 100uF seemed to work the best. If you find something better, please let me know. Now this only gave me a number. I needed to change that number into something meaningful, ounces. To do this I weighed a bunch of things with my wifes postal scale and also weighed them with my scale. After doing the math, I discovered that dividing the analog reading by 10.65 gave me almost perfect results. I was happy. The tie wrapped blue wire in the middle goes to the Arduino. We'll get to those. The green LED is very important. It tells me when the current measurement is done. Very important. So also is the blue pushbutton. Here's why. As of this version, the procedure for getting the weight of beer is as follows:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. Press the blue button. This tares or zeros out the scale. Everytime a digital scale is turned on it takes a moment before it reads. It has to compensate for the load cell because temperature affects its readings. We do the same. It doesn't send a zero to the arduino. Mine is a value of about 120. I take 100 readings of the output once the button is pressed and the average of those become my \"zero\". When the green LED blinks rapidly 2 times, pauses and repeats, taring is done. 2 . Set the container, empty or partailly filled,\u00a0on the scale and wait until the green LED blinks 2 times, slowly. This gets that weight of the container so we can subtract that from the weight of the container and the beer for a beer only value. The LED is now blinking 3 times rapidly, pausing, and repeating. 3. Pour your beer and set it on the scale. I programmed a 500ms delay before weighing to compensate for the jostling of the beer. Wait for the green LED\u00a0blink 3 times slowly and go off\u00a0and there you have it, a weight of only beer sent directly to your PC. If your PC is next to your keg, you don't need XBee. If not, you do or we could work on a WiFi version too! *NOTE: The 2 rapid blinks means you are on step 2 (set container on scale), and 3 rapid blinks means step 3 (waiting for full glass or container). Ok, back to the circuit. the green LED has its cathode going to a 220 ohm resistor and then to ground. The anode is the white wire going to the Arduino, pin 12. The push button has one point connected to 5V, and the other with a resistor (10k) going to ground. In between the resistor and the button is the red wire going to the Arduino, pin 2(NOW USING INTERRUPT!!!). The red and black wires leaving the bottom of the pic go to a 9VDC wall wort that powers the entire system including the Arduino. When I was experimenting with the load cell, I found that it worked best with 3.3V. The scale out ot the box used two AA bateries in series which is approximately 3.0V, so this made sense. This load cell had four wires, which is pretty common. It had /- excitation and /- signal. The negative excitation goes to ground. The black wire coming from the left is the negative excitation voltage. The green wire goes to the positive excitation, and is the 3.3V from the Arduino. The red and white wires coming from the left are signal for red and - signal for white. What was cool about the scale that I bought and had no idea of beforehand, was that all four wires were labeled on the circuit board that the load cell was connected to! Red and black to the /- voltage, and the blue to signal and white to - signal. I'm not sure what the \"I\" stands for, but it ended up being signal. Also, I'm not sure why I didn't use red and black for voltage on my board, I just didn't. Feel free to change it on yours. The Arduino board is pretty simple. Moving from left to right. The blue wire which connects to the green wire is the analog input. Even though it is hard to see, the next wire, red, is the regulated 5V that feeds the breadboard. The next wire, also red, comes from the 3.3V on the Arduino and goes to the Aref and the white wire (again, hard to see, sorry!) back to the breadboard to power the load cell. The next wire, black, is ground. It is very important to \"common\" your grounds when using multiple power supplies and/or devices. Last, but not least, is the feed from the wall wort to power up the Arduino. That is it for connections! Shall we talk about code? Step 2: Coding It All. <PIC> Coding the Arduino was pretty simple. Here is the code. Just upload to the Arduino, make all connections, and you are ready to go. Here is my completed scale. Again, the packaging stinks, but I wanted to get it up and running. I'll work on a better package. If you come up with something, let me know. After powering up the system, the value of the variable \"fullKeg\" is stored and every weight is then continuously subtracted giving you the values of tare, glass weight, beer weight, and the weight of beer left along with the percenatge of the keg on your serial monitor. I'm working on the VB.Net code. To reset the system after a new keg has been installed either power the system down or press the reset button. Here's the Arduino code: int dataInPin = 5; int goPin = 12; //int tarePin = 8; volatile int Flag = 0; int quickDelay = 100; int smallDelay = 500; int bigDelay = 1000; int checkVal; int tareVal; int glassVal;

Nacho salad2. Carrot salad3. Chickpea saladPerfect for hot summer days when you want a colourful and healthy meal that's easy to make and delicious to eat!If you like this video and any (or all three!) of the recipes, it'd be super cool if you could subscribe to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/DarnyouglutenfoodThank you, have a nice summer :) Step 1: Nacho Salad. <PIC> 1. Start by placing the sweet corn in a mixing bowl. Slice the cherry tomatoes in half and add to the mixing bowl. Using scissors, you can add the spring onion. Peel and dice the red onion before adding it to the colourful m\u00e9lange. Remove the white and the seeds from the red bell pepper then dice it into pieces and add to the bowl. And finally, cut the cucumber into small pieces, toss it into the bowl and mix all the ingredients together.2. Pour the olive oil into a frying pan, add the paprika and heat up. Add the red kidney beans, the tomato paste and a dash of water (to loosen the pur\u00e9e). Stir on a high heat for a couple of minutes, until the water has evaporated and the kidney beans are coated in the tomato sauce.Once that's done you can leave the beans to one side to cool slightly.3. Now place the green peas into mortar and start muddling them into a paste with your pestle. Once they have been thoroughly crushed you can add in the half avocado. Grind the two ingredients together until a thick, sort of smooth paste forms. If you want something super smooth you'd probably be best using a little food processor.4. All that's left to do is to combine all the parts together in a large, and I mean large, bowl. Pour the veges in, top with the beans and 'smashed peas and avocado' - then grate the mature cheddar on top, as finely as you wish.  And there's our first vegetarian salad; a huge nacho flavoured, extremely colourful bowl of deliciousness. Step 2: Carrot Salad. <PIC> 1. Start by peeling the carrots. Then grate them finely. If you have a machine to do this then it might be a good idea to use that if you're making this for a lot of people... if not, it really doesn't take that long to grate the carrots. Place the carrots in a bowl. Add the shelled sunflower seeds to the bowl, as well as the 10 cashews. Then you can pit the dates, if they are not already pitted, and slice them into little pieces before adding them to the carrots. Finally, slice the cherry tomatoes in half and add them to the rest of the ingredients. Place this bowl in the fridge whilst you prepare the courgette so that the flavours can develop.2. I'm using courgette from my garden, so the skin is a bit tough and I won't be using it, but normally I would incorporate it into the salad anyway. So it's up to you whether or not you use it. Grate the courgette using a larger sized grate than you did for the carrot. Then mix it in with the rest of the salad. And that is it. Step 3: Chickpea Salad. <PIC> 1. Start by placing the chickpeas in a zip-lock bag with the olive oil, paprika, garlic powder and salt. Shake together and make sure all the chickpeas are coated with the mixture. Then spread them out onto a lined oven tray. Place in a an oven that has been pre-heated to 180\u00b0C (350F) for 30-40 minutes - or until crunchy. 2. Whilst your chickpeas are roasting you can prepare the rest of the ingredients.Rinse the spinach and place in your serving bowl. You can also chop the spinach up and mix it in with the other things.Peel and dice the red onion into small pieces then toss into a large mixing bowl. Slice the red bell pepper then cut it into small chunks and add to the bowl, and don't forget to add the sweet corn too.3. Once the chickpeas are ready, you can add them to the mixing bowl  and mix them in. Then crumble 2/3 of the feta cheese into the mixing bowl, as well as on top of the spinach. Then pour your mix over the spinach and feta mix and top with the last of the feta.

In fact, I'd like to take a moment just to thank the Earl of Sandwich for allowing us all to indulge in the glorious simplicity of food between two pieces of bread. Being  in a hurry unfortunately often means that any sandwich that gets thrown together is either a sorry collection of fridge bits and cold cuts or an amalgamation of what we scrounge up from last night's leftovers. Certainly these can be good, but why not enjoy something on the fresher side without really sacrificing much time?This recipe takes at the very most twenty minutes to put together at the very most and will have you crying the tears of joy that could only be cried while eating the best damn sandwich you've ever had. Step 1: Ingredients and Tools. <PIC> For a pair of sandwiches you'll be needing:Ingredients:4 Slices of Pork Tenderloin (about 45 grams each)1 Medium Tomato (Sliced into 4 slices, the rest makes great snacks while cooking)4 Leaves of Lettuce (trim the bottom inch off to get rid of the bitter bits)ThymeRosemarySalt and Pepper to tasteTools:Frying PanTongsCutting boardTwo Plates Step 2: Maillard Is Our Friend. <PIC> Let's get cooking!Here's what we need to do:Season the tenderloin slices and toss in a plate to ensure they are evenly coated. Heat a pan to high heat with no oil - remember the title of this step, Maillard* is our friend. Put the pieces of the tenderloin onto the pan, remember to space evenly (they are supposed to stick here) Flip when dark and golden on the bottom and the top is framed in white (about 1.5 - 2 minutes) Once both sides are finished put into the second place to rest for about 5-10 minutes During the rest time slice the tomatoes and snap the bottoms off of the lettuce leaves. Assemble your sandwichWe use a quick cook method like this to avoid the greatest culinary sacrilege to ever become commonplace. Pork should never, Never, NEVER be grey. Pork can be pink, but it must be at an internal temperature of 145 F (63 C) to kill the nasties. If your pork is dry, flabby, and sickly looking it means the temperature was too low and it was cooked for too long. We seek to lock in the juicy, pork flavors rather than let them bleed out into the ban to become ash. *The Maillard Reaction is basically where the amino acids in protein break down and reform into the delicious brown crust that we so crave on meat. The reaction with oil and heat is different stuff so we don't want any of it involved here. Step 3: The Sandwich Sitch. <PIC> So what else can we add to our sandwich? Well in Bavaria I had some boar with currant jam that still haunts my every pork dish so that always goes along well with some creme fraische. I'm a simple man these days so I just throw on some mustard and mayo without too much flair. Naturally toasting the bread or going full blown panini is an option as well. In fact, if there's anything from this recipe to take away it's the way I cook the tenderloin. Armed with that you could make any sandwich with any conceivable flavor under the sun. So go forth friend and make the best sandwich you could imagine, but be sure to share as I too wish to indulge in that delightful simplicity that is two pieces of bread and a few things in between which you have come up with.", "images_list": ["seared-pork-tenderloin-sandwiches-for-two_0", "seared-pork-tenderloin-sandwiches-for-two_1", "seared-pork-tenderloin-sandwiches-for-two_2", "seared-pork-tenderloin-sandwiches-for-two_3"]}

In order to extract gluten from wheat flour, it should be formed into a dough and soaked in water. The gluten present in the wheat flour does not dissolve in water and sinks at the bottom. When filtered the gluten is strained out and removed. The remaining wheat flour (wet) can be used to make various recipes. Note :Although this processing often removes the gluten protein, some residual gluten may still remain in it. Wouldn't recommend for people with Gluten intolerance or sensitivity. For people who aren't fighting gluten sensitivity, this can be a way to construct a new diet. Step 1: Removing Gluten From the Whole Wheat Flour. <PIC> 1) Knead the whole wheat flour into a soft dough by adding water little by little.(like a chapathi dough)  2) Soak the kneaded whole wheat flour dough in 2 cups of water for a minimum of 1 hour.3) The dough would have become very soft after soaking for 1 hour. Mix the soaked dough and water together. This will make the gluten separate out and settle down.4) Then filter the milk through a mesh/filter.5) The gluten will be strained out. Discard the gluten and keep the whole wheat flour milk for the preparation of the dishes.

Step 1: Things You'll Need. 1. At least 12 pieces of bacon...maybe more just to be sure2. 4 large eggs3. 2/3 cup of shredded cheese4. An oven5. A few Bayer Aspirin to avoid a heart attack  Step 2: Weaving the Bacon. <PIC> Okay so first things first preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, so it's hot when we put the bacon in. Now while were waiting for the oven it's time for the fun part, weaving the bacon ;D. I used 13 pieces of bacon but it all depends on how tightly you weave it.           To start, lay down 6 to 7 pieces of bacon horizontally, and make sure that there aren't any spaces in between.           Then, start weaving the next 6 to seven pieces. Do as I did in the picture and just weave over then under then over etc. and be sure to switch that pattern on the next piece to cause the \"basket\" effect.

This part is simple all you need to do is crack four eggs open, add a splash of milk, whisk, and scramble. Step 5: Putting It Together. <PIC> By now you should have all your eggs done, and the oven timer is probably about to go off. When it does, take the (now shrunken and brown) bacon out of the oven. Then, dump all the eggs out onto the bacon and spread them around evenly. Do the same with the 2/3 cup of shredded cheese. Now, roll it all up and put some toothpicks into it to keep it from unrolling. After it's all rolled up throw it back into the oven for another 3 to 5 minutes. Step 6: The Final Bacon Masterpiece. <PIC> Now for the final product ;) After the 3 to 5 minutes in the oven, your bacon roll is done.

LETS EAT!!! Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> I got the idea for this recipe from the book \"Making Sausage\" by Warren Anderson. It's actually a combinations of two sausage recipes, minus the curing salt, and not grinding and stuffing the meat. Thanks to Warren for the inspiration! This is a great book for those who want to make sausages too!What you need:2 1\\2 lbs. pork loin (mine was unexpectedly bone in)1\\3 cup honey1\\4 cup sugar1\\4. cup sherry1\\4 cup Yuzu Ponzu (this is a citrus infused soy sauce, regular soy can be used instead)1 tsp. red food coloring1 Tbsp sesame oil2 cloves garlic, crushed2 Tbsp fresh ground ginger2 Tbsp red chili paste1 tsp white pepper1 tsp Chinese 5 spicemy pictures show salt, but I did not add any because of the ponzu. It is salty enough for me.A note on measurements: The above measurements are a guideline, based on whats in the book. I do a lot of this to taste. I suggest you do the same. I added more sesame oil, five spice, and chili paste. I also put in a lot of ginger. Taste often and adjust to your liking. Tools:A sharp knifeCutting BoardMicro graterBowl with a lid, or large zip loc bagBamboo skewers (mine are 9\" long and flat) Step 2: Cut and Trim the Pork. <PIC> I used a pork loin end roast, and I got one that had a chunk of bone in it by mistake. I didn't catch this on the label when I picked it up. I cut out the bone, but left a lil meat on it for making a stock later on.When trimming meat, there are two kinds of connective tissue. One is fat, which in small doses is good as it adds moisture and flavor to the meat. The other is silver skin, which will be chewy, and hard to eat. Remove all the silver skin, and leave a lil fat for flavor. The amount you leave is up to you. This being a marinade, not a lot is needed in my opinion.Slice the trimmed meat into one inch cubes for the skewers. My last photo shows the bone, the scraps, and the diced meat. I got about 2 lbs. of meat after trimming. Step 3: Make the Marinade. <PIC> Measure all the wet ingredients into a bowl, honey added last. This will make it easier for the honey to dissolve. Don't forget the red food coloring. It makes it look like Chinese BBQ pork! So cool!I then added the sugar and mixed it well to dissolve that too. I then used the edge of a spoon to peel the ginger. I grated the ginger with a microplane into the bowl. I crushed two cloves of garlic (skin on) with the flat side of the chefs knife. This makes it easy to peel. The peel comes right off after crushing them with the knife. I microplaned these into the marinade like the ginger. It was hard to hold though, and some big pieces got in there. I then added all the dry ingredients and mixed it well.A taste test let me know to add some more sesame oil, chili paste, and more five spice. Add the pork and mix well again. This needs to marinate for three days. Mix the marinade at least once a day. Step 4: Make Kabobs!!. <PIC> After three days, drain and rinse the pork.While you're doing this, soak about 12 skewers in water. This helps keep them from burning on the grill. Pour the meat onto paper towels, and pat dry.Now, I made a grill just for kabobs, so I got these 9\" flat bamboo skewers for my grill specifically. You can see how I made my Kabob Grill in one of my other instructables. It has 6\" of space for cooking, so I have 1 1\\2\" on each side to support the kabob on my grill. I placed the meat evenly on the skewers, leaving the required 1 1\\2\" on each end. You can use any skewer you like, but I found that flat ones keep the food from rolling around. Step 5: Time to Grill!!. <PIC> Start by starting a chimney of charcoal. I use paper and paraffin wax. The coals aren't ready until the smoke disappears, and the top coals start to turn white. When they're ready, put them in the grill. It took about 20 minutes for the coals to get hot.I made this grill with kabobs in mind. I put foil on the edge of the grill to help with clean up. I spread the coals out evenly in one layer. Put the kabobs on the grill. The fire was hot so I used gloves when I was tending the fire.Turn the kabobs as they brown. I turned them a a few times each. The coals were hot, I could have let them burn down a little to control the heat better. The kabobs came out great regardless! They took about 5 minutes total to cook. The charcoal makes all the difference in the flavor.I hope you like this instructable! If you did, please vote.

{"id": "RECIPE_1472", "question": "What\u2019s the best way to create a cake layer leveler that ensures a perfectly even cake top?", "provenance": [40941], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Cake Layer/Leveler Cutter. <PIC> My mother-in-law had an issue with one of her tools that she used to level a cake.  Looking at the design of the original, I decided that I could make something that would eliminate some of the problems.  The problem was the flat blade was flimsy and the frame wasn't sturdy.  Put those two problems together and you get a wavy cake top and an angry mother-in-law and nobody wants that.   Step 1: Parts and Tools. <PIC> Parts(1) piece of wood about 21\" long, 1.5\" wide, and about 2\" tall.(1) length of piano wire.(4) 5/16 nuts or (2) 5/16 nuts and (2) washers(2) 5/16 bolts 10\" long(2) 1/2 nuts(make sure that they go on the bolt easily by hand)(2) 1/2 bolts 7\" longToolsDrill w/bitsSandpaperWood Stain and a brush or clothNeedle nose pliersHacksaw(2) 1/2 wrenches Step 2: Getting Started. <PIC> Find the right size drill bit for your bolts.  The 1/2\" bolts don't need to be snug at all but you don't want too much wobble either.  Drill your 1/2 bolt hole about .5\" from the side of the wood on the left and right side.  Then drill your 5/16 bolt hole 1.5\" from the side on the left and right side of your wood.  After that you will need to make a hole on each end for your 1/2\" nut.  It needs to meet the bolt when it comes through and it doesn't need to be allowed to spin.  I don't have the proper tools to accomplish the task so I just drilled a couple holes and then whittled it until it fit.  Next, take a hacksaw and cut a groove into the end of each 5/16 bolt.  The piano wire should fit when your done. Step 3: Sand and Stain. <PIC> Now it's time to sand your wood as much or as little as you want.  I left some marks on the wood and it actually made it look more interesting to me.  After your done with sanding make sure that you clean your wood off really well.  I don't know much about staining wood but what I did was use a brush and brushed up to three coats(letting each coat dry in between).  I have seen some people rub stain on with a cloth. Step 4: Finish It!. <PIC> Enough playing around with the stain.  Now it's time to start adding those nuts and bolts.  Start with the (2) 5/16 and (2) of their nuts(or just the washers if you bought those).  Take your piano wire and bend a small hook in it.  Circle it around one of the bolts and then hook the wire to itself.  This will just be to hold the wire in place.  After you've done that add the next nut to the same bolt that you have your piano wire hooked to.  You will use your double nut configuration to pinch the wire together to hold it taut.  If you bought the washers instead then you will have the piano wire hooked around the bolt between the washer and nut so that they pinch it.  Make sure everything is tight.  Run the piano wire up the bolt and through the groove that you made with the hacksaw.  Pull it tight and make a 90 degree bend.  This next part is optional.  I used some vise grips to make little zig zags in the wire in order to make it cut easier.  I don't make cakes or cut them so I don't know for a fact that it works.Put both nuts(or washer and nut) down on the bolt that is on the opposite side.  Tighten one bolt completely down and leave a small gap in between the two nuts so that you can insert your piano wire later.  Now your ready to pull the piano wire taut and insert them in the grooves of your 5/16 bolts.  After your piano wire is tight enough, pinch it in between the nuts(or nut and washer) and tighten it.Take the (2) 1/2 nuts and insert them into the holes that were made for them earlier.  Screw in the 1/2 bolts into your finished assembly and your done.    Step 5: All Done...time for Cake!. <PIC> You can now adjust the 1/2 bolts to change the height to suit your needs.", "images_list": ["cake-layerleveler-cutter_0", "cake-layerleveler-cutter_1", "cake-layerleveler-cutter_2", "cake-layerleveler-cutter_3", "cake-layerleveler-cutter_4", "cake-layerleveler-cutter_5"]}

{"id": "RECIPE_1479", "question": "What are the steps to craft a delicious spicy cinnamon apple soda at home?", "provenance": [40946], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Spicy Cinnamon Apple Soda And/or Mixer. <PIC> This is a recipe for a sparkling red spicy apple cinnamon soda. \u00a0It requires no special equipment and only one special ingredient (sort of.) \u00a0It takes about 15 minutes of prep time plus a few days waiting time, and is about 50% real apple juice. \u00a0It's a family-friendly drink straight from the bottle, or a fancy cocktail if you mix in some rum or vodka. \u00a0It's also completely free of high fructose corn syrup and can be made reduced sugar style. Step 1: Ingredients and Equipment. <PIC> Ingredients:\n\u2022 No Sugar Added Apple Juice - reconstituted from frozen concentrate is fine, too.\n\u2022 Cinnamon Red Hot Candies - you can find these in movie theater style cardstock boxes. year-round, or as Cinnamon Imperials around Christmas and Valentine's Day. \u00a0They're often sold to be used as cupcake decorations.\n\u2022 Sugar - plain old granulated white is fine, honey works, or a sugar substitute if you're looking to reduce a few calories.\n\u2022 Brewer's Yeast - I used Pasteur Champagne yeast, any ale yeast would work, and bread yeast is okay, if a little less tasty. \u00a0My packet of yeast was a bit less than $1 and would make around 16 liters of soda. \u00a0Once you have some in your fridge you'll want to start carbonating everything.\n\u2022 Water - tap water works fine for me, but do a one-bottle test if you've never tried anything with your tap water and yeast before. \u00a0There are some water additives that can keep yeast from working well. \u00a0(I go into this more in troubleshooting.)\nEquipment\n\u2022 1 or 2 LIter Plastic Bottles - If it has contained carbonated liquid before it can do it again. \u00a0I used VERY CLEAN 1 liter bottles that had previously contained some carbonated flavored water. \u00a0Don't use glass bottles. \u00a0You can purchase bottles for this sort of thing from brewing supply companies if you don't have handy recyclables or want to be fancy.\n\u2022 Measuring Spoons\n\u2022 A Funnel (not absolutely necessary but definitely handy)\n\u2022 Microwave safe glass pitcher or a small saucepan\n\u2022 Something to stir with Step 2: Mix Your Ingredients. <PIC> The following directions make 1 liter. \u00a0Adjust your quantities accordingly.\nPut your funnel into your bottle.\nPour 1/4 cup sugar (or equivalent sugar substitute) into the bottle.\nHeat 1 cup of water to boiling in the microwave (using a MICROWAVE SAFE container).\nPut the cinnamon red hots into the water and stir until they dissolve:\n2tbsp for lightly cinnamon\n4tbsp for a nice, spicy cinnamon\n6tbsp for very spicy\nmore if you're feeling adventurous/ hate your tongue\nYou can do this on the stove if you would prefer (especially if you were making a lot of syrup at once.)\nSlowly add 1 cup of cool water to the red hots mixture.\nPour the mixture into the bottle.\nPour 2 cups of apple juice into the bottle *making sure to leave 1 to 2 inches of empty space at the top* (you may need a bit less than 2 cups).\nClose the bottle, check that it's sealed, shake it to dissolve the ingredients together. \u00a0Make sure it's at a nice warm but not hot temperature. \u00a0100 to 105 degree Fahrenheit is ideal if you have a thermometer handy, otherwise shoot for something that feels cozy but not hot.\nAdd 1/8th of a teaspoon of yeast. \u00a0Close the bottle up again and shake it to mix in the yeast. Step 3: Wait (and Some Bonus Safety Info). <PIC> Put the bottle(s) in a nice warm location. \u00a0Think about micro-climates where you live - I often put my bottles above the dishwasher or refrigerator, or under a furnace vent.\nCHECK THE BOTTLES REGULARLY. \u00a0As soon as they feel dense/hard they're fully carbonated. \u00a0You're shooting for something that feels like a 2 liter on a grocery store shelf. \u00a0You won't be able to dent it with your fingers. \u00a0Do not open the bottles at any point while you're waiting of you'll un-do the yeast's hard work. \u00a0My bottles generally take between 12 and 24 hours.\nAs soon as the bottles feel nice and dense get them to somewhere cold. \u00a0A refrigerator is ideal, anywhere nice and cold will work. \u00a0You need to make the yeast go dormant at this point because it will keep building up carbon dioxide pressure until the bottle bursts. \u00a0This is why glass is a bad idea - a red sticky explosion mess would be bad enough, add shards of glass to it and you've got a potentially scary situation. \u00a0Champagne yeast is designed to build a higher pressure than soda bottles are designed for this cooling step is really important.\nThat said, if you put your bottles somewhere cold as soon as they're hardened up, you almost completely eliminate the explosion risk. \u00a0Don't make more than you'll consume in a few weeks, but don't be afraid to leave your unopened soda in the fridge for a while, I've found that the flavor improves over time.\nYour soda will have a tiny bit of alcohol in it. If you have an alcohol allergy you shouldn't drink it, but I would venture to bet that even in most very young kids they would suffer ill effects from the sugar and cinnamon long before they could drink enough of this stuff to get drunk. I've also read that home brew sodas are lower in alcohol than grocery store orange juice, but that's from the internet so I don't really know if it's true. Step 4: Troubleshooting. If your soda isn't carbonating here are a few things that may have gone wrong:\nToo much heat. \u00a0If your mix was too hot when you added the yeast you may have killed it. \u00a0(I've had good luck with adding a bit more yeast and letting it sit for a while longer.)\nBad water. \u00a0Some cities have water that is unfriendly to living things. \u00a0The first thing to try is to boil the water you're going to use and then let it sit until it cools back to a yeast-safe temperature. \u00a0If that doesn't work you're probably looking at trying distilled water.\nToo cold. \u00a0If you're keeping your soda in an area that's too cold it will never carbonate. \u00a0Try to find somewhere warmer to set it.\nNot enough time. \u00a0A lot of recipes say it will take 3 to 4 days for soda to be ready. \u00a0I think I have fast results because I micromanage.\nNot chilled long enough. \u00a0CO2 needs time to dissolve into a liquid. \u00a0If your bottle has hardened up but it's not carbonated when you open it, you need to let it chill for longer before drinking. Step 5: Serve. <PIC> It is important to chill the soda in a refrigerator at least overnight before serving. \u00a0Cold is required for carbon dioxide to dissolve into the liquid. \u00a0Without chilling you'll open your bottle, let all the CO2 out and drink flat soda. \u00a0With the chill you should end up with a very nicely carbonated beverage.\nSome crud will collect at the very bottom of your bottle. \u00a0Don't drink that stuff. \u00a0Don't shake the bottles, pour them smoothly and don't pour our the last little bit of the bottle. \u00a0The stuff at the bottom isn't dangerous, it just tastes icky. \u00a0It's mostly debris from the yeast, but in this case there is probably also some wax from the candy mixed in. \u00a0If you intend to keep using these bottles you'll want to rinse them right away to get this stuff out. \u00a0It will be much harder to remove if you let it dry there.\nAs a mixer:\nThis stuff is great mixed with rum or vodka the same way you take a rum and coke or a vodka lemonade. \u00a01 ounce of alcohol mixed with 3 to 6 ounces of soda is good place to start, adjust as desired.", "images_list": ["spicy-cinnamon-apple-soda-andor-mixer_0", "spicy-cinnamon-apple-soda-andor-mixer_1", "spicy-cinnamon-apple-soda-andor-mixer_2", "spicy-cinnamon-apple-soda-andor-mixer_3", "spicy-cinnamon-apple-soda-andor-mixer_5"]}

Learn what ingredients do in a cookie recipe and how to change them for different cookie results. You'll be creating your own cookie recipe in no time! Step 1: Fat & Sugar. <PIC> The foundation of any cookie recipe consists of five types of ingredients: fat, sugar, flour, a rising agent, and a binding agent.\nFat is added for flavor and controls how chewy or crunchy the cookie is. More fat = a chewier cookie, less fat = a crunchier cookie. Your options for fat are butter, margarine, shortening, or oil. Since shortening melts at a higher temperature, it is the best choice if you want to keep spreading to a minimum.\nSugar is a sweetener (obviously!) and tenderizer, while controlling how much the cookie spreads. Using white sugar will result in a crispier cookie, while brown sugar will help retain moisture, making cookies chewier. Adding sugar increases the spread of a cookie, so cookies with less sugar will be puffier. Ever notice how sugar cookies spread like crazy?! Step 2: Flour, a Rising Agent, and a Binding Agent. <PIC> Flour is a stabilizer and thickener and controls how much the cookie rises. It holds the cookie together, providing it with its structure. If you use too little flour your cookie won\u2019t keep its shape but if you use too much you\u2019ll end up with a thick tasteless cookie. Also, different types of flour result in different cookie textures. For example, cake flour provides a cake-like texture (go figure!). All-purpose flour is the standard flour used most often.\nThe rising agent or leavener most commonly used is either baking soda or baking powder. If you use baking soda, your recipe must include another acidic ingredient, like sour cream, lemon juice, or buttermilk. On the other hand, baking powder has its own built-in acid. Baking soda increases browning and spreading, resulting in a flatter cookie. Baking powder will give you a puffier cookie.\nBinding agents are the liquid in the recipe that hold the cookie together. Examples of binding agents are eggs, milk, honey, and fruit juice. Cookies with more eggs will rise more and spread less. If you want a crispier cookie, you can replace a whole egg with just an egg white. Or, if you want a chewier cookie, you can replace a whole egg with just an egg yolk. Step 3: . The rule of thumb for cookie baking is to always keep the amount of fat and sugar used relatively equal. There should be less than 1/4 cup difference between the two. The amount of flour used should be about two times the amount of fat. To determine how much flour to use, start with equal amounts of flour and fat and then increase the amount of flour until the dough is slightly tacky. It is better to have too little than too much. And you should add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of your leavener for every cup of liquid or flour you use (use liquid to determine the baking soda, use flour to determine the baking powder).\nOnce you have these basic rules down, you can start to tinker with recipes to make them more to your taste.

{"id": "RECIPE_1516", "question": "What is your approach to making delicious biltong or jerky at home?", "provenance": [40970], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Making Biltong or Jerky. <PIC> Jerky is a great way to preserve meat in order to be eaten at a later date.  It makes a great treat, snack, or even part of a meal.  I like to make it in order to take with me when I go hiking or to be eaten as a snack as I drive home from work.  My method of making Jerky is a very simple.  It uses the basis of Biltong, which is an African dish that is preserved game meat.  I made a few changes to this traditional meal to make it into a jerky.Preserving food is a skill which has been  forgotten by many in our modern world. Learning and perfecting the   process of storing meat is a great skill for any person seeking   self-sufficiency. Whether you live in the country or in the city you   should be able to find space to practice making Biltong, gaining   confidence in knowing that you can store meat for later consumption.   Biltong is a method of curing strips of meat in order to preserve what   is available at a time of abundance, for use when meat is not available.   The type of meat extends to almost any animal, yet I normally use Beef   or game as for me it is so easily available. Step 1: What Will You Need to Make This?. <PIC> The process of making Biltong is not overly complicated, and the majority of the ingredients are inexpensive to purchase.Vinegar (I prefer Apple Cider as I find it adds great flavor)  Salt (preferably Himalayan Pink Salt, yet any salt will work in a pinch)  Ground Black Pepper  Ground Corriander Seeds  MeatThe ingredients are my own personal preference.  If you can't find the Pink salt, go with which ever salt you can find (although I would recommend against a rock type salt.  It requires more salt to work, so your food will be very salty).In addition, many types of meat can be used, some people have had great success with  Fish, Chicken and Game meats. I usually stick to Beef, yet  I know that  Kangaroo Biltong is also very tasty. The above list of  ingredients is  just the basic requirements. It is not uncommon for  personal taste to  play a factor in the ingredients. Chilli, Garlic,  Brown Sugar and  Worcestershire sauce do make for some great  modifications to the recipe.  I will leave it to you to consider your  own tastes and modify  accordingly. Step 2: Slicing the Meat. <PIC> Traditionally the meat is cut into strips of around an inch (2.5 cm) in  width, making a rectangular prism (or box) shape. I have found that I  get much more enjoyment from the biltong when it is cut thinner, perhaps  around 25/64 of an inch (1cm). The length of the strip is only limited  to the location you intend to dry the meat. I use a meat dryer that I  built, so the strip is limited to 9 inches (20 cm). I prefer to remove  all fat from the meat while I am preparing the cuts. The fat won\u2019t spoil  the biltong, yet in my opinion it can make the taste of the meat less  palatable (or waxy) and can also make it tougher.Once the meat is sliced into the appropriate dimensions it is placed  into a large bowl and soaked in the vinegar. It is recommended that you  allow between 12 to 24 hours for the meat to marinate in this liquid,  yet I have had no problems with as little time as one minute in the  vinegar. The vinegar will add flavour to the meat and, more importantly,  will create an acidic environment that will almost eliminate any chance  of botulism. Once you are satisfied with the marinating it is time to  add the spices.aten it  all. Step 3: Spicing the Meat. <PIC> To prevent wastage and to ensure a proper coating, it is wise to add each ingredient individually. I place the meat on to a work area (for  example, a chopping board). I usually start with salt, taking a pinch of  salt and evenly spreading over each side of the meat. I have tried  several types of salt in this step and I have had the best results with  Himalayan Pink Salt. It is very subtle and does a great job of drying  the meat without adding too much saltiness. You can easily add too much  salt here, so I find the less the better. One pinch of salt can be used  for an entire slice of meat.Once I am satisfied that the meat is very lightly coated, I sprinkle on a  dash of black pepper and a liberal coating of ground coriander seeds.  It is at this stage you could add your other spices.Once you have coated the meat you are ready to set them aside in a  refrigerator to start the process of drying. In more simpler times you  would have set the meat out to dry and hope the insects could not find  them. Now you can leave the meat in your fridge (preferable sitting on a  cooling rack which is placed over a tray to catch the fluids, yet that  isn\u2019t too important) to begin the drying process far from the attentions  of curious flies. I have been told that flies will not land on the  drying biltong due to the faint aroma of vinegar and the black pepper\u2026 I  do not believe it. I have seen flies land on many things much more  disgusting than drying meat so I do not believe they are too finicky to  try some of the biltong.If you own a meat dehydrator you could follow the unit\u2019s instructions to  dry the meat, yet I prefer to use more simple solutions. This is to  either use my custom built, passive meat drier, or to hang the meat on  strings which I have placed in a shaded area. I would recommend that you  place the meat inside (at least for the first few days) if you are not  using an enclosed container so that insects are not attracted to your  work.It is important that the meat be placed out of direct sunlight, as well  as in a location which has easy access to fresh air. I prefer to do this  in the summer, so that I am guaranteed to get a gentle warm breeze  which helps to dry the meat. To hang the meat I use paper clips, which I  have modified by bending them slighting and skewering the meat at the  thicker end before hanging the meat to dry.After a couple of days you can, if you can\u2019t wait, try the biltong. It  normally takes around 5-7 days for my biltong to be dried to a stage  which I like (as dry as cardboard). I would recommend trying it daily  till the meat has reached a stage which you are satisfied. When the  Biltong is ready, remove it from the hangers and store. It can be vacuum  packed for longevity, yet I find that it stores fine in a mason jar. I,  however, don\u2019t normally worry too much about storage\u2026 it tastes so good  that it rarely lasts more than a couple of weeks before I have eaten it  all.", "images_list": ["making-biltong-or-jerky_0", "making-biltong-or-jerky_1", "making-biltong-or-jerky_2", "making-biltong-or-jerky_3"]}

Step 1: Pepper Preparation. <PIC> Buy these peppers on sale. \u00a0You're going to be canning/processing/pickling these bad boys, so you don't need highest quality. \u00a0Make sure they're free of bugs and have no soft spots, then buy a TON. \u00a0I got about 10lbs and wound up with 9 quarts.Cutting\nSee the pictures below. \u00a0Make sure you have a really sharp knife and insert it at an angle almost parallel to the side of the pepper. \u00a0Make a quick cut around the top and pop out the stem/seeds. \u00a0You'll want to wash the peppers later to remove more seeds, or leave them in for a kick-you-in-the esophagus mouth-melting pepper. Step 2: Pepper Pre-Processing. <PIC> Brine\nI used about 4 quarts white vinegar and 2 quarts water with 1/2c kosher salt. \u00a0Bring everything to a boil and then add the garlic. \u00a0Simmer for about 15 minutes to let the garlic \"infuse\" into the brine.Peppers\nWhile the brine is brining slice all your peppers into approximately 1/8\" thickness. \u00a0These will pack tightly, so don't worry if you break a few.Garlic\nI decided to roast the garlic for extra flavor. \u00a0Just cut the top off of a bulb and put it in the oven at 400F for about 15 minutes or until it turns brown. \u00a0Mash it up and then stir it into the brine. Step 3: Pepper Packing. <PIC> Make sure your jars are sterilized before starting. \u00a0If I plan ahead enough I can run the jars through the dishwasher and they come out squeaky clean and piping hot.\nPack as many peppers into each jar as you can, because it'll make your brine go further and save space on your pantry. \u00a0I packed them in as hard as I could, and I was glad I did.\nOnce the peppers are packed, ladle brine over them using a careful hand or a funnel (I use a funnel) and put on the hot lids and tighten firmly. Step 4: Pepper Processing and Perfection. <PIC> Once the peppers are packed and brined make sure you remove all the air bubbles with a knife, chopstick, or other implement. \u00a0You want to leave about 1/2\" of headspace at the top to make sure the seal will form properly. \u00a0Be very careful of the temperature of the jars, the water, and the counter. \u00a0Process for 15 minutes and let cool in the canner before removing. \u00a0Check after a couple of hours to make sure the seals are puckered. \u00a0Allow to cool completely and store in your pantry for up to a year.\nIf you've been keeping count you'll see that I have 1 less jar now than when I started. \u00a0I decided to process in 2 batches to save on weight and when it came time to do my second batch one of the jars cracked open as soon as it touched the water. \u00a0In the future I'd put the jars in hot water in the sink during the 20 minutes of processing.\nAll in all though, at the end of the day I'm left with a peck of pickled peppers.", "images_list": ["how-to-pickle-a-peck-of-peppers-peppercinis_0", "how-to-pickle-a-peck-of-peppers-peppercinis_1", "how-to-pickle-a-peck-of-peppers-peppercinis_2", "how-to-pickle-a-peck-of-peppers-peppercinis_3", "how-to-pickle-a-peck-of-peppers-peppercinis_4"]}

Take a glass baking dish or in my case two glass pie dishes and add your butter (about 1 table spoon in each dish), place the dishes into the oven to melt. In a medium bowl scramble up the eggs, add in the milk, yogurt and sugar. Mix well, next gently mix in the flour or pancake mix and stir until evenly mixed. Take out the dishes and add your mixture to the melted butter. Place back in the oven and cook till the tops start to turn a golden color. Remove when done and set aside to cool.For the topping take a medium pan add in your berry fruit (washed), water and sugar. Cook on medium to high heat till it comes to a boil stirring frequently. Once it is at a boil the fruit will start to break down.  I rapidly mixed with a fork breaking down the strawberries further to a jam like consistency and removed from heat and set aside.  Next add the berry jam and pour it over the pancake in the baking dish.  The juices will seep into the top layer of the cake, yum.  Next for decorative purposes I added a few more strawberry and banana slices covering the pancake. Serving:Cut the pancakes out of the dish and place on a plate and get ready to enjoy the first meal, Yum!

Cumin5. Dill6. Cayenne Pepper7. Tony Chachere Creole seasoningFor the all-important Fish Taco Sauce, start off by placing even parts (one for one) yogurt and Mayonnaise in a bowl. I usually do about \u00bd -1 cup of each depending on the number of people I plan to feed . Next, add about a teaspoon of Cumin, a teaspoon of Dill, a \u00bc teaspoon of Cayenne and \u00bc Tony\u2019s. Add more cayenne if you like yours spicy! Last, but not least, the lemon juice. I add about 1-2 lemons worth of juice hand squeezed. (The leftover rind is good to cook with on the grill/oven to add more flavor to the fish) I do make this sauce to taste, so taste as you go and make it your own!For the tacos, build them up as you like. I take the beans first and put them on the tortilla then take your cooked fish and place it on top of the beans. Next add your veggies: the lettuce, tomatoes, onions and place over the fish. Then the most important ingredient, the Fish Taco Sauce! Lay it on thick or thin. This is the sauce of sauces for any white fish. Next top with cheese, wrap it up and Enjoy! Step 3: Dinner. <PIC> Ok, so on to the the main meal. I kid you not, the most desired meal in my house is some good old fashioned country food. My wife's and my favorite meal is specially prepared venison steaks, homemade mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. It is so simple but so amazing. My venison recipe amazes everyone who tries it and they are often in disbelief that venison could be so tender and delicious. Also my mashed potatoes are a real treat! so here we go!This recipe will work with other wild game meats, my favorites that I like to use are Deer, Duck and Rabbit.\u2022 Vienison ~ 2 lb\u2022 Olive oil\u2022 Tony Cahceres\u2022 Seasoned salt\u2022 Italian seasoning\u2022 Black PepperVenison, unlike beef or pork, has little to no fat content and because of this it must be prepared differently in order to keep it tender. For tips on processing, check out my instructable on proper processing a deer (link coming soon). You can use any cut of venison meat and make it tender without having an over powering game taste. The secret is in the preparation. Remove all sinew, fat and slimy membrane from the meat. This can be done easily with a fillet knife. To help tenderize and \"add fat,\" the secret is olive oil and a fork. Every venison recipe I have created uses this heart healthy oil. Olive oil helps to prevent the meat from burning while providing a medium for seasoning (Tony's, black pepper and seasoned salt). The fork tenderizes and infuses the meat with oil and seasoning. Take a glass bowl, add the cut up venison, add the olive oil and seasonings, and then gently take the fork and poke/pierce the meat evenly. Let it set for a few minutes or up to a day in the fridge. Now the meat is ready to be cooked.My country mashed potatoes:Cut the potatoes (3 per person, I used 6) into small cubes, place in a medium pot cover with water and boil till potatoes are soft and be easily crushed with a fork. Remove from heat and drain. Once drained add in butter (1/2 stick) and mix around till fully melted. Next add the sour cream (3/4 cup) and mash/mix the potatoes until an even consistency(if the potatoes seem dry you can add in a bit of milk). Lastly add in your spices, I use season salt and black pepper.Steamed BroccoliCut up the broccoli (3 heads) and place in steamer and cook till tender. I also add just a dash of season salt to the broccoli. Step 4: Dessert!. <PIC> My amazing strawberry brownie cake will be the treat to top off the night. For a link to my full recipe with more pictures click here.Brownies:I use two Ghirardelli dark chocolate brownie mixes. One mix for each 9 inch circular pan. After mixing place the batter into the lightly greased pans and bake until the brownies are to your desired doneness. I like them to be a bit under done and gooey :) Remove the brownies and set aside on a plate.Whip cream:Start off mixing the heavy whipping cream in a blender or if you want an arm work out do it with a whisk. Add in the sugar slowly and taste every so often until you reach the desired sweetness. I don't like it very sweet because the brownies are plenty sweet.The Build:First I cut up the strawberries into thin slices and place them in a bowl. Next I coat a layer of whip cream onto the bottom brownie. Then apply the strawberry slices to the whip cream layer until completely covered. Next add the second brownie layer and coat with a layer of whip cream all over once complete add strawberry slices until completely covered.This cake is so good, but so not good for you :) Step 5: What Really Happened on Valentines . <PIC> Ok, so the day was a success but not everything on the original menu was made :( The reason was because everyone in the family came down with a nasty virus the day before (go to the hospital bad). That being said we had to change out a few items for ones that did not have dairy.

You'll be the hit of the party, and it's not even hard to do.\u00a0 A note for purists: This isn't the definitive way to make carnitas tacos. In fact, it's kind of cheating because I use a crock pot instead of roasting a big piece of pork for many hours in the oven.

It's no doubt much healthier.\u00a0 One more thing: This recipe is perfect for a party in the park.

Chop up your peppers, taking care to remove the seeds. Peel and roughly chop your garlic and toss it in the pot, too. If you have it, throw in 1/2 Tbsp each of cumin, oregano, and onion powder. The dry ingredients are optional, but if you have them I would recommend using them.\u00a0 Turn your crock pot on low and cook for 8-10 hours. I usually cook the meat the day before I actually want to eat carnitas tacos and just put it in the fridge once it has cooled. You'll see that this is not a problem and may even be preferable.\u00a0 Step 2: Prep, Shred, and Cook. <PIC> \n          When you're ready to cook your tacos, get yourself prepared so you can bang them out quickly. You want two things here: 1) a hot cast iron skillet that will retain heat and 2) partially shredded pork. Carefully break up your pork. It will already be falling aprt from the crock pot cooking, but since it's been sitting in the fridge all night, you can still keep some large pieces intact. Don't shred your pork too finely because you want some chunks of meat. Mmmm. Meat. \u00a0 Heat up your cast iron pan while you:\u00a0   Dice your white onion     Chop up your cilantro     Stack up some tortillas  The actual cooking is easy. In your hot skillet (gas on high for a few minutes prior) pour 4-6 Tbsp. vegetable oil into your skillet. Using tongs, fill the bottom of your pan with a layer of partially shredded pork. Don't stir. Turn your heat down to medium and let it cook for a few minutes. Then, rearrange the meat so that you can crisp up the parts that aren't crisp. After a few minutes more, you should start heating up your tortillas, preferably in another pan or on an open flame.\u00a0 Step 3: Plate and Try Not to Eat Too Many!. <PIC> The great thing about cooking these in a big cast-iron pan is that you can push crisped up meat to one side and add more meat as you go \u2014 serving from one side of the pan while replenishing crock-pot pork from the other. Cast iron holds its heat, so you won't need to worry about adjusting the temperature. Just stick to medium after you get going.\u00a0 It's important that you get some decent crispiness, so it's okay if the meat stays in the pan. It may dry out, but you will be adding salsa and citrus when serving, so don't worry too much about that.\u00a0 To serve, heat two tortillas per taco and lay them on a plate on top of each other. Place some carnitas on the tortillas, sprinkle with white onions and cilantro, and slap a spoon of top-notch salsa on each taco. Garnish with quartered radishes and lime or lemon slices.\u00a0 Repeat until everyone is happy.\u00a0", "images_list": ["impossibly-easy-carnitas-tacos_0", "impossibly-easy-carnitas-tacos_1", "impossibly-easy-carnitas-tacos_2", "impossibly-easy-carnitas-tacos_3"]}

It started as a recipe called Major Marshall's chutney in a preserving book published by the British Sugar Bureau in the 1970s. I have gradually changed it - less tomatoes and apples, different spices. I have always tried to cook it outdoors, because I hate the way it makes the whole house smell of vinegar. I used to cook it on a gas barbecue, though it tends to burn on the bottom of the pan if you aren't careful.

Step 3: Cook the Chutney. <PIC> Put everything in the slow cooker and cook on high for about 8 hours, stirring halfway. Then take the lid off and continue cooking on high for another 2 hours or more, until the chutney is thick and there is no loose liquid.

{"id": "RECIPE_1571", "question": "What\u2019s the best way to elevate inexpensive balsamic vinegar for a richer flavor?", "provenance": [41001], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Kick Up Cheap Balsamic Vinegar a Few Notches Using This Technique . <PIC> My son and his wife stayed with us for a few months last summer. We were remodeling our home and spent a lot of time outdoors so she offered to do all the cooking. It was quite a treat for me because she taught me some of her techniques and I got a break from cooking. She made a fantastic salad dressing using balsamic vinegar and it was then, that I realized I wanted to add it to my grocery list. After they left I purchased a bottle at the store not knowing the less expensive brands don't measure up to the more pricey ones. This experience forced me to find out what makes a good balsamic vinegar and find one in my home town.  After I purchased this bottle, I was looking through my refrigerator to see what I needed to add to my grocery list and was delighted to find a tiny bottle of balsamic vinegar that had a few drops left in it. I knew my kids left it here. After carefully reading the label I could see why it was so good.  The recent contest inspired me to make an instructable on balsamic vinegar and that is how I discovered this secret technique or so I thought. More on that later. Follow through and I will share what I have learned during this adventure and  how to make a better tasting balsamic vinegar using the less expensive brands.  Step 1:  Balsamic Vinegar. <PIC> I did a little research about balsamic vinegar because I wanted to purchase a good brand that I could afford. I learned that a lot of the cheaper brands have a large water content and a long list of ingredients. I also learned that the better brands usually list where they were bottled, how long the bottle was aged, what type of grapes where used and if I recall, the region where the grapes were grown. The better brands usually have a thicker consistency more like a light syrup that will stay put when dribbled onto a plate.   I purchased a couple bottles but they did not have the really good flavor that was in the small bottle that my daughter -in-law left here.  The bottle above had two ingredients Red wine vinegar and grape musts. It was aged 4 years in wood. With that said:  I would like to mention that I have changed my cooking habits, like many of you, for the past ten years or so, mainly because of the long list of ingredients on the packaging labels. A couple of days ago I read an article on Yahoo news about an interview with Campbell's Soup CEO. Hey everyone they are paying attention to the consumers buying habits and have plans to change in the next couple of years. No GMO's, food coloring or high corn syrup  and  let's hope other companies will follow. Anyway . . . .here is how I discovered the technique I will be sharing: I decided to make a bottle of chocolate balsamic vinegar and cooked the balsamic vinegar over the stove to make it thicker.  I discovered that cooking it gave it a richer flavor and creamier texture. I thought I was on to something. Well, as it turns out; I was making a vinegar reduction. I have to chuckle about that; I always say knowledge is power. I did not take pictures of the balsamic vinegar before I cooked it; but it had a very runny texture, much lighter appearance and the flavor was just not there. There were just enough drops left in the tiny bottle of good stuff to compare it to. The one on the left was the reduction and the one on the right was the good stuff. The reduction did not make the less expensive mixture equal to the good stuff, but it tasted a whole lot better and might pass off as a good middle priced brand. I will be using this method in the future by adding herbs and seasonings and make some homemade versions.  Let's get cooking . . .  Step 2: Ingredients . <PIC> You will appreciate the short list.Ingredients and utensils: 1 bottle of inexpensive balsamic vinegar.A non-reactive heavy bottomed sauce pan; preferably stainless or something light in color so you can view the color changes of the liquid , large spoon or heat proof spatula,funnel, and hot pad or towel.Patience and overhead vent or open the window. The vinegar cooking will smell very strong.Save the bottle and lid to store the balsamic vinegar. Step 3: Cook. <PIC> Set the timer for 20 minutes and cook over medium low heat stirring frequently and watching closely to prevent the balsamic vinaigrette from burning.While your waiting sterilize the bottle and lid. You will know when it is ready when the back of the spoon has a light coating and the vinegar has been  reduced to about half.Remove from the heat. Step 4: Cool. <PIC> Place the hot pan on a towel or hot pad to cool for several minutes.Using the funnel pour the mixture into the sterilized bottle and put the lid back on.  As you can see there is only about a half of a bottle left.I didn't actually start with a whole bottle because I had already used some of it for other recipes. Step 5: Sunshiine's Final Thoughts. <PIC> We liked the newer version of the balsamic and I have been using it on vegetables and tomatoes from our garden, and fresh strawberries.  It inspired me to made an olive oil ice cream that was screaming for balsamic vinegar. This method is a great way to experiment with a new recipe before using the more pricey brands. I hope you try this method on the next bottle you purchase. The more you know has become my moto.

You may want to skip this step if you just want to make a quick heart that has no color scheme.  You will need a total of 68 starburst for the heart so you will have extras, but don't eat any just yet.   Step 2: Making the Cubes. Your first gluing task will be to create 34 \"cubes\" by gluing two starburst together on the broad sides.  I put cubes in quotation, because they are not quite perfect cubes, although they are very close.  You can choose to glue your starburst in a pattern as you make cubes, or you can glue them randomly.   Step 3: Arranging the Cubes Into a Heart. <PIC> As you make the cubes it  is helpful to begin arranging them in a heart formation as you go.  The above template should just be used for the general shape.  It is very random as to what colors you will get in a bag of starburst.  I suggest improvising and trying to make a pattern based on the colors you get.   Step 4: Glue the Cubes Into Columns, Glue the Columns Into a Heart.. <PIC> After you make the cubes begin by gluing columns of cubes together.  I find it best to hold the cubes on a flat surface while gluing them to make sure the columns are straight.  Step 5: Clean Off the Hot Glue Webs and Enjoy!.

{"id": "RECIPE_1582", "question": "What is the process for crafting a sculpted Hellboy cake, and what key techniques should I employ?", "provenance": [41007], "ground_truth": "Introduction: How to Make a Sculpted Hellboy Cake. <PIC> Hello everyone!\nThis is the cake I made for my first cake show competition. It was for That Takes The Cake 2011 in Austin, TX. I've onyl been making cakes since August 2010 and this is still just a hobby for me until I get the funds to get everything I need to start up a business and I'm self-taught so I'm super happy that I even placed in the top 10 at the show. I came in 8th!\nI had a lot of issues and mistakes but I learned a lot and am now planning and starting my next sculpted cake for a show at the end of April.\nThe theme for the Showcake category at That Takes The Cake was Super Heroes and Villains from comics, books, movies and TV. I chose to make Hellboy because I love Mike Mignola's work, as well as the movies and loved Ron Perlmann as Hellboy.\nDepending on your artistic skill, this could be hard or easy. Towards the end of this cake I didn't get as many photos, as I was behind on time, but I hope this Instructable can at least give you the basics on how to make this!\nThe head and arms are rice cereal treats and the rest is Devil's Food cake (felt that was\u00a0fitting for Hellboy)\u00a0covered in fondant and then detailed and hand painted with gel food colors. One of my mistakes was hand painting the skin and base. I hadn't yet learned to use the airbrush I recently bought and was out of time so I hand painted it and it came out really splotchy, with brush marks and was way too wet and shiny for way too long. I would definitely recommend using an airbrush! Although the texture was great for the coat.\nI also didn't build up the shoulders and I should have, as once the heavy fondant was on they shrunk in. Also didn't use enough support dowels and separators inbetween every few layers so his body started to settle and compress down with the weight of the cake (this is the biggest cake I've ever made, learned a lot!) but his head and top of shoulders were made out of the rice cereal treats and stayed up on the supports, so he eventually came apart, starting even before judging. The 4 hour drive to the show I think hurried the process along.\nHere's a list of general supplies I used to make the cake:\n\u2022 Cake pans for baking the cakes. I used a quarter sheet pan for all of the cake.\n\u2022 General cake decorating supplies: Mixer, spatulas, turn-table, carving/clay/fondant/gumpaste tools, matt to roll fondant on, fondant rolling pin, gel food colors, knife, cake leveler, toothpicks, food-safe paintbrushes, small containers to mix food color \"paints\" in, tape, cake support dowels, etc.\n\u2022 Ingredients to make cakes, buttercream icing, fondant and to mix food colors with (you will mix the food colorings with something like vodka or clear vanilla extract, not water.)\nI had to make a wooden base to support such a heavy cake so I've shown that in this Instructable too. I used two 24\" x 24\" x 1/2\" plywood pieces, and a larger wooden dowel and wood screw and then a pack of wooden cabinet knobs as the feet, so that it would be easier to get fingers under the heavy cake and board.\nHere's the link to the alterations made to a box cake mix to make it a little stronger to better support sculpting. I altered this recipe a little, adding an extra egg and an extra half cup of flour.\nhttp://cakecentral.com/recipes/7445/the-original-wasc-cake-recipe\nHere's the link to how to make the marshmallow fondant, which is pretty yummy, although very sweet! Pre-made fondant can be bought if you do not want to make the marshmallow fondant but beware that some of the pre-made doesn't taste very appetizing. Two brands that do taste good are Satin Ice and Fondx. I've used the Wilton once before and it's not too great tasting.\nhttp://www.wilton.com/forums/messageview.cfm?catid=7&threadid=137541&FTVAR_MSGDBTABLE=\nHere's a simple recipe for the buttercream icing, a 2 lb batch. This uses shortening in place of butter. I'm in Texas and butter doesn't hold up as well. If you don't have a stand mixer or don't want to make your own icing you can buy some pre-made.\nIngredients:\n2 Cups Shortening\n2 lb bag Powdered Cane Sugar (or approx. 8 Cups)\n4 TBSP Meringue Powder\n2 tsp Vanilla Extract (use clear vanilla if you want your icing to be white)\n2 tsp Butter Flavor (use clear flavor if you want your icing to be white)\n1 tsp Almond Extract\nWater\nDirections:\nSift together powdered sugar and meringue powder into large bowl. Set aside.\nMix the flavor extracts together in a measuring cup. Add enough water to the mixture to bring the amount to 1/2 a cup. Put this into a mixer bowl with the shortening.\nAdd about 1/4th of the sifted powdered sugar/meringue powder mixture to the shortening and flavors in the mixer bowl. Beat on a slow speed with the paddle beater and the slowly incorporate the rest of the powdered sugar mix into the mixer bowl as it's slowly mixing. Once it's all in there I usually turn it up a notch in speed for about 1 1/2 - 2 minutes. Then it's done!\nKeep it covered until you are ready to use it, as it will \"crust\" over if you are not ready to use it and leave it uncovered to the air. Step 1: Making the Base. <PIC> To make the base to support such a heavy cake, I used two pieces of 24\" x 24\" x 1\" plywood. I rounded off the edges of both boards, rounding the front edges more. The display table at the show was rounds so I wanted the base to be rounded off. I then glued them together with wood glue and nailed them together.\nYou can see an extra strip\u00a0I added on the back egde. That was to be for some elements that I had to omit due to time constraints so that can be ignored. :)\nOnce it was together, I sanded it all down. Then I drilled a hole in the center where I wanted my main support dowel to be, the same size as the wood screw shaft, but smaller than the screw head. For this support dowel I chose a 1/2\" dowel, 24\" long since the minimum height for the competition was 24\". I made a small hole in one end with a small drill bit. Then I pushed my wood screw through the hole in the base from the bottom and screwed on the support dowel.\nOnce done I added some plain wooden cabinet knobs I found at Walmart that came in a pack of ten. I drilled small holes in the base where I wanted the feet to be and then attached them with wood screws. Step 2: Covering the Base With Fondant. <PIC> Next I made a large batch of the fondant and covered the base with it.\nAfter making the fondant and setting it aside, all wrapped up so it wouldn't dry out, I brushed on a layer of piping gel to the top of the base and sides and about an inch over the\u00a0edge on the bottom. This gives something for the fondant to stick to.\nI rolled out the fondant and layered it on the base in several pieces, as I couldn't roll a big enough piece to cover the whole thing in one piece. This was OK though since I was going to cover over the seams where the pieces met.\nAfter this was done I rolled out the rest of the fondant and cut random tapering, curving strips and layered them on top of the fondant covered base, radiating out from the center support, mostly in front. These fondant pieces were \"glued\" to the fondant on the base by brushing some water on the backs of them before putting them down on the base. Step 3: Stacking and Carving the Cakes. <PIC> Before I stacked the cakes on the base, I covered the base with plastic wrap, leaving a rectangle of space around the dowel uncovered, so that I could apply icing there before stacking the cakes so that they would stick to the base. The reason I covered the base is so that when I was carving the cake, covering it with icing and fondant, the fondant bas wouldn't get messed up by cake crumbs and icing.\nI stacked the cakes, with buttercream in between the cakes. Every 4 cakes I would insert smaller dowels, cut to the same height of the top of the top layer cake, then cut down a carboard cake board, cover it with wrap, and place it on top of the doweled cake, to help support it. I should have done this better, and with every two cakes instead of every four, and used slightly bigger and thicker cardboard. Perhaps using hot glue to glue a few cardboard cake boards together. Still learning about cake support and this was definitely a learning experience!\nI ended up using 10 quarter sheet cakes. I also was trying to use up all the leftover icing I had made from my cake decorating class so that's why it's multi-colored. :)\nNext I shaped the stacked cakes a little with a knife. I had tons of Hellboy reference photos printed out and layed on the counters so I could look at them easily. Step 4: Shaping and Adding the Head and Arms. <PIC> Next I made a triple batch of rice cereal treats, using the recipe on the Rice Krispies box (also on their website) and used them to shape his head and arms.\nDidn't get photos of this process as while doing it my hands were lightly coated with Crisco so that the treats wouldn't stick to my hands and I didn't have time to keep stopping and washing off my hands to take photos. :( I was running behind!\nI formed the pieces around the smaller cake dowels, with parts of the dowels sticking out so I could push them in to the cake when attaching them.\nAgain I had photos all around me while doing this for easy reference. Step 5: Covering the Cake With Icing & Fondant. <PIC> Next I covered the cake and cereal treat with buttercream icing. That gives the fondant something to stick too and helps get smoother coverage, a little \"padding.\"\nAfter covering with icing I rolled out fondant to start covering. Again, here's where the Instructable kind of ends, as by this time I was way behind and needed to finish so we could make the 4 hour drive to the show.\nI covered it in pieces. Working \"background to foreground.\"\nFirst I covered all the showing skin areas and head (minus the sideburns and the horns)\u00a0and sculpted and detailed them along the way before they dried out too much. I had made hollows for the eyes and\u00a0after it was covered added the\u00a0eyeball and eyelids separately.\nNext I did the pants, then belt and horseshoe and rosary.\nNext was the lower portion of the coat, then the sleeves, then the upper portion of the coat.\nLast was to add the ears,\u00a0the sideburns of the hair and horns.\nI used gumpaste/fondant tools for all the detail.\nAfter it was finished I painted it with Wilton food colors mixed with vodka. you can use either vodka, clear vanilla or other clear flavor extracts, or other clear alcohol to mix the colors with. Water makes fondant gummy and too much will ruin it so you want to use water as glue and alcohol to paint with, as it will evaporate, leaving behind the color and not ruining the fondant.\nAfter the show was over I kept the base, to reuse, and the head since it was rice cereal treats. I took some better photos of the head after I got home.

If you bought fresh anchovy fillets then you are lucky.3. Once you gutted the anchovies, put the flour in a large bowl. You will coat the anchovies in flour. You have 2 options: Throw all of them at once in the bowl and using your hands coat them in flour OR coat them one by one (they are quite fragile and this way they will keep their shape better.4. Heat up the oil in a medium size sauce pan. When the oil is hot enough, throw in (carefully) the anchovies. Make sure there is enough space in between them. Depending on the size of your pan and the amount you are frying you might need to do it in a few batches.5. Enjoy!

If you can use basic kitchen tools, you can make these beautiful desserts!To begin, you'll need the following supplies:4 red apples (red delicious have a beautiful skin for this project, but any red apple will do)1 lemon (or 2-4 tbsp of lemon juice)Apricot preservesFrozen pastry puff dough (like Pillsbury)CinnamonYou'll also need the following tools:A large microwave-safe bowlA sharp knifeA small bowlA microwaveA muffin tin Step 1: Prepare the Apples. Begin by cutting the apples into VERY thin slices. If you have a mandoline, that can be helpful, but not necessary. You want your apple slices to be 1/8 of an inch or less - the thinner they are, the easier it is to roll them up later!After cutting your apples, place them in a large, microwave safe bowl. Add warm water to just cover the apples, and add the lemon juice to the water. Swish the mixture around to mix the lemon juice in (this keeps the apples from browning).Microwave the apples for 3 minutes on high. This will soften the apples to make them workable. Afterwards, drain the water from the bowl. Step 2: Prepare Your \"glue\". The apricot preserves are going to help hold your apples in place.

I've been wanting to make my own chocolate bark for a while but I wasn't sure what to do. I've also been wanting to make something with freeze dried fruit, but didn't know what to do with that either. The other day I saw wold630's Pop Rocks Chocolate Bark and decided to combine the two ingredients! Step 1: Supplies. You can change these up as much as you want to suit your tastes.Ingredients:12oz  Chocolate~ 1 1/2 chunks  Almond Bark or white chocolate Orange Extract Freeze Dried Fruit* - I used about 1/4 cup of each (~1 cup total) but I would actually suggest maybe even using more. It didn't seem like as much when I cut it up, so more might be better. I used the following, but use whatever you want. RaspberriesStrawberriesBlueberries Mango - I only used this for color, I would probably leave it out if I did this againSupplies: Parchment Paper / or /  Wax Paper / or /  Nonstick Baking SheetPan - it's just handy to have something to put your parchment paper on so you don't mess up the bark if you have to move it around Microwave safe containersSpatula of sorts*Using just strawberries or strawberries and raspberries would be good for Valentine's Day Chocolate Bark. Step 2: Prepare Fruit. I decided to add raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and mangos. While some of these were kind of small, I decided they weren't small enough (especially the mango which were in big strips). Cut down your fruit into smaller pieces so they sit nicer on your chocolate. Since the fruit is freeze dried, it is going to be a little crumbly. Just be careful when you cut but you can always throw the crumbles on the chocolate too. Step 3: Melt Chocolate and Assemble Bark. Get your wax paper out and ready before you start so you are ready when the chocolate is melted.You need to melt the chocolate to make the bark. Put it in a microwave-safe container, and microwave in 30-second increments. Make sure you stir between putting in the microwave as it will be melted and not always look like it. I started with my base chocolate and then threw in my almond bark after.Spread the chocolate on your wax paper so it is fairly even. Don't make it too thin or it will be too weak.Once my almond bark was melted, I mixed in some orange extract. Since this is going on top of your base chocolate, you can be generous with the flavor as it won't be your main flavor. I'd say I must have put in a teaspoon or two. Adding the extract changed the consistency of my almond bark, so I couldn't drizzle it like I wanted, instead I smeared it carefully on my base chocolate with the back of my spoon.Once all the chocolate is on, drizzle on your fruit. You want to do this before the chocolate hardens. Gently push it down after you put it on so it stays in the chocolate. Feel free to put on more fruit than I have. I felt like once it was broken up into pieces, it didn't seem like as much. Step 4: Let the Bark Harden. You need to let the bark harden before you can break or cut it up. I gave it about, eh, five hours and it still wasn't totally hard, but you could touch it at this point. If you can, give it more time. I started by breaking it, but didn't like how it broke, so I cut mine into piecesI took a lot of pictures, so you have to look at them!", "images_list": []}

{"id": "RECIPE_1640", "question": "What is the process for creating a flavorful homemade SPAM with kombu misubi?", "provenance": [41045], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Homemade SPAM With Kombu Misubi . I have early memories of Saturday morning breakfasts of SPAM. Salty, meaty, fried and curled up around the edges. I liked it then, but years later, out in the wilderness, I tried again and almost choked at the salt content. It drowned out any flavor the meat particles once had and made me thirsty for an entire day. Still, I couldn\u2019t help but appreciate the survivalist capacity of SPAM and that iconic can-well traveled, dust covered, nostalgic, and dinged in ways that suggest a storied past. Years later, I was in a gas station in Hawaii and very hungry. Under the heat lamp were the usual choices-hot dogs, burritos, and then SPAM, served over sushi rice and with a sliver of seaweed holding it together. I had heard about this this East- -meets-tinned-meat staple known as masubi. It seemed like the safest choice of the light bulb- cooked buffet. It had a sweet teriyaki sauce that balanced out the salt, and despite my biases, I enjoyed it.  SPAM utilizes pork trim that normally goes to waste, so it was an early adaptor in our growing awareness about food waste. I set out to make my own SPAM, with less salt, but still using parts of the animal that are normally wasted. So I made one out of pig trotters, and a salmon SPAM from collars, bellies and tails. Step 1: Buy Pig Trotters. This is not as easy as one might think. Using trotters for SPAM was first suggested to me by a butcher at the Ferry Plaza Market. However, the butcher told me they were out, as all the chefs wanted them. I felt a little smug. I was out there sourcing alongside top chefs in San Francisco. When I was finally able to get some, the butcher advised me: \u201cJust cook them for a good, long time until the meat falls from the two bones going through the hooves.\u201d Step 2: Slow Cook Pig Trotters. Put them in a big stock pot on low heat.  I added some salt- (if you can get ahold of Morton\u2019s Meat Curing salt, that will make it more pink, like original SPAM), bay leaves, paprika, salt & pepper. I let the pig hooves simmer for about 4 hours. I was expecting the bones to slip out, leaving a pork belly-like mass behind. Step 3: Make a Mess. When I took one out, the bones didn\u2019t slide off fatty, meaty flesh. So I worked out the two biggest bones, that were encased in thick skin. Even when I had them removed, still, no meaty reward, just more bones that resembled toes. Yes, pig toes, with gristle and bones and padding. I was out of my league. This was a skill learned from hard knocks during the Depression or by chefs working their magic. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing-besides making a huge, greasy mess. I put it into a Cuisinart and blended it. The more it blended, the more I realized that I didn\u2019t ever want to eat this. I certainly didn\u2019t want to give the fatty, gnarly, thick skin ground into a paste to other people. (A hand cranked meat grinder would work better). So I compromised and ran out and bought humanely raised, local, organic ground pork and mixed it 1:1 with the trotter gurry. Step 4: \u200bMix With Ground Pork, Shape and Freeze.  Next, I mixed the trotters with ground pork. I also added some sage leaves, pepper and about a tablespoon of chili flakes. I divided it into half and packed each into plastic bag, and then put into a bread pan. I then placed these into the freezer so that it\u2019s frozen into shape. Step 5: Slow Cook in Sous Vide or in Oven Double Broiler. I cooked this in a Sous Vide machine for four hours. This might be the only reason people aren\u2019t breaking their teeth on the boney-bits. However, you can also use a good meat grinder, and then DIY Sous Vide it by filling a baking pan with water and then placing the SPAM inside to bake at a low heat. (See salmon SPAM Instructable for doing this). I\u2019ve also heard that you can use a dishwasher to Sous Vide, but that\u2019s an entirely different Instructable. Step 6: Let It Sit in Fridge Overnight. I put it in the fridge overnight, and the next day took it out for a look. It was the right shape, the hue almost pink, and the gelatin from the pig hooves seemed to bind it all together. There was a layer of fat congealed on the outside, but you just call that lardo and consider it a delicacy. Step 7: Slice and Cook It. Get oil or butter really hot, and flash fry it for 20 seconds on each side. Step 8: Make Masubi. For the masubi, make sushi rice. If you can\u2019t find it, try Calrose medium grain. You can add a little saki and piece of kombu to the cooking rice if you\u2019d like to flavor it a bit. When it\u2019s done, put it into a bowl.

{"id": "RECIPE_1646", "question": "What is the overall process for creating your own Garlic Amino Salt at home?", "provenance": [41049], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Garlic Amino Salt. <PIC> Taking a cue from Chalt, I decided that I should like to make an amino heavy salt. I have previously been led to believe that the flavor advantage of sea salt, particularly highly regarded sea salts such as sel gris, fleur de sel and varied other examples, is the mineral and amino content imparted by the brine from which it is collected. My intention in this case was to create a reduced salt with far-increased amino content, intended to be used in a similar way to soy sauce, but without the addition of liquid. I'm calling this salt \"Garlic Amino Salt\", as its ingredients are sea salt, alderwood smoked salt, black garlic powder and minced preserved garlic. Step 1: Initial Addition. <PIC> As this is a small-batch experimental recipe, I started by adding 250 mL of Spring Water to a medium saucepan over high heat. Once the water started boiling, I reduced the temperature to medium, and added 50g of an ordinary, mid-price Sea Salt. Step 2: Super-Saturation. <PIC> I then began attempting to super-saturate the solution with sea salt. After adding 25g more salt, I discovered that the solution was too thick, and added 100mL more water. The solution at that point seemed too thin. I then added 3g of smoked salt and 5g of sea salt, and started adding water in 15mL increments. After 5 such increments, I decided that the solution was appropriately dilute as to be supersaturated at boiling. I then added the black garlic and minced garlic, boiled for 2 minutes more, and poured the mixture through a plastic filter I purchased online into a 2.2qt Pyrex baking dish. It was then placed in an oven at 275F, as shown. Step 3: Precipitation/Drying. <PIC> I checked the solution at 15 minute intervals, observing the drying taking place from the outer rim of the dish inward, as illustrated in the following sequence. Note that significant precipitation happened in the first 15 minutes of the process. Step 4: Final Drying. <PIC> After 90 minutes of such, I found that the solution had dried into a loose cake. I removed the dish from the oven and stirred it using a silicon spatula. The resulting aggregate was semi-moist, with pockets of completely dry salt interspersed. I decided that the mixture could use more drying and placed it back in the oven for another 30 minutes. Step 5: Completion, Tasting. <PIC> At this time, I removed the salt from the oven and stirred it up once again. It had become dry throughout, excepting a few small, moist clusters that nonetheless crumbled between my fingers. Tasting the new salt, it was intensely savory, with a significant but far-reduced saltiness from the original sea salt. I think it would work well as a salt replacement at anywhere from 1:1 to 1:2.5, for any recipe that the cook wanted to make more savory and wouldn't mind including black garlic flavor. Step 6: Final Thoughts. I believe this recipe would be helped by the inclusion of a vacuum hood for the reduction of the salt, coupled with a significant reduction in drying temperature. When using a vacuum hood, however, I would double the black garlic content and remove all minced garlic. The inclusion of some (5g on the light side to 15g on the heavy side) dried roasted garlic would be preferable to minced garlic in this case.\nThis experiment had an unexpected but not altogether unwelcome side effect. On a first attempt, I accidentally added the garlic and black garlic early, and decided I should start over. Not wanting to waste perfectly good black garlic, I put the failed recipe in a Pyrex loaf dish in the oven, without filtering, and the garlic mixture reduced down to a thick paste. I intend to put it in a yet undetermined amount of olive or canola oil, and use the result as a cooking paste or condiment.\nThis instructable is based on a post made on my blog, which includes the experimental data I recorded during production of the salt.\u00a0", "images_list": ["garlic-amino-salt_0", "garlic-amino-salt_1", "garlic-amino-salt_2", "garlic-amino-salt_3", "garlic-amino-salt_4", "garlic-amino-salt_5"]}

Me and sister\u00a0loved our\u00a0mom's monkey bread, it\u00a0was\u00a0extremely\u00a0good. She\u00a0would\u00a0give us a little\u00a0sample\u00a0of it right\u00a0as it was cooling down and even that little piece was enough to make\u00a0any human's\u00a0mouth water, it was hands down my favorite dish\u00a0that my mother\u00a0cooked. However, the problem with my mother's Monkey Bread is that she\u00a0would only make it\u00a0three times a year, and those three times were on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the Fouth of July. Since she only made it on those specific days it would make us look forward to those holiday dinners.\u00a0Me and my sister would countdown to those holidays\u00a0several weeks\u00a0before it actually arrived, all because of the anticipation of my mom's amazing Monkey Bread. Unfortunately, we would anticipate it so much that when that amazing time finally came we would eat the Monkey Bread\u00a0too fast leaving us with nothing but a shortly\u00a0lived memory and an even\u00a0stronger craving for more.\u00a0Any time we would ask mom to make us Monkey Bread for any day other than those three holidays she would\u00a0always decline our offer. It just was not fair that we had to wait so long\u00a0to enjoy this delicious treat. All of this changed on my 21st\u00a0birthday when me and my sister were begging my mother to make me some Monkey Bread for my birthday. My mother once again said no but made a counteroffer of teaching us how to make it so that way we will never have to beg her about it ever again. After learning how my mother makes her Monkey Bread, I have come to realize just how easy it\u00a0is to make, and\u00a0I am going to teach you exactly how to do it. - The estimated time of completing this task is about an hour altogether. - The skill level of this task\u00a0is\u00a0about\u00a0easy to medium. Almost anyone can make a\u00a0great batch of Monkey Bread. However, since it requires working with the oven and\u00a0hot contents and food i strongly suggest that\u00a0only people over the age of 17 years old\u00a0make Monkey Bread. Anyone younger than 17 years old should be supervised. Step 1: Ingredients and Materials. <PIC> - (3x) 7.5oz Cans of Pillsbury Buttermilk Biscuits - 1 Stick of Butter - 8oz of crushed almonds, walnuts or pecans (your choice) - 1 cup of sugar (strongly suggest having butter at room temperature) - 1 cup of brown sugar - 2 tablespoons cup of cinnamon - 1 bunt pan - 1 large sized Ziploc bag - 1 food scissors - 1 sheet of wax paper - 1 measuring cup Step 2: Preparation. <PIC> ***The first thing you are going to want to do is make sure\u00a0that all of your tools are clean. Be sure to wash hands thoroughly as well because you will be coming into contact with the ingredients a lot throughout this process. -Grease\u00a0the bunt pan thoroughly. (You can do this task with pam or use some butter) - Take out\u00a0a sheet of wax paper. Should be around a foot long. - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Step 3: Assembly. <PIC> - Cut each individual uncooked biscuit into 4 equal pieces and lay it on the wax paper \u00a0\u00a0 ~Do this for every single\u00a0 buiscuit until you have none left and the wax paper is filled with mini pieces of biscuits - Pour both the cinnamon and sugar into the plastic Ziploc bag \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ~Be sure to shake and mix the Ziploc bag\u00a0thoroughly\u00a0to properly mix the cinnamon and sugar together - Sprinkle your choice of nuts into the bottom of the well greased (or buttered) bunt pan - Gently add the sliced biscuits into the bag of\u00a0cinnamon and sugar mixture. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ~\u00a0With the sliced mini biscuits in the Ziploc bag shake the bag until each biscuit is well\u00a0coated in the mixture \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ~ Repeat this process until all of your slice biscuits are coated - After all of the slices are coated, put them into the greased bunt pan \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ~ Layer the pieces accordingly (refer to the last picture above) Step 4: Making the Sauce. <PIC> - Melt the 1 stick of room temperature butter in a pan over medium heat. - Add brown sugar to melted butter until fully incorporated. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0~ Stir occasionally - Let the butter and brown sugar mixture cook slowly until the sides of the pan start to bubble. - Let the brown sugar mixture cool down until thickened. - Once the sauce is cooled down pour the sauce over the biscuit pieces that are in the bunt pan \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0~ Spread evenly with a near spatula \u00a0\u00a0 ~ Sprinkle additional nuts over the sauce (optional) Step 5: Bake. - Carefully place the bunt pan into the preheated oven. \u00a0\u00a0 ~ Place on middle rack for best baking position - Set the timer for 40 minutes to let cook. ***WARNING \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Do not open the oven door when baking.This will\u00a0cause the Monkey bread to \"fall\" and will not maintain a good risen shape\u00a0 Step 6: Post Baking. <PIC> ***CAUTION: When Monkey Bread is done baking the bunt pan and all of its content will be extremely hot and may cause burns. Be sure to wear protective hand gear and pulling the Monkey Bread out of the oven. - Carefully take out the Monkey Bread out of the oven and place onto the stove - Once on the stove let the Monkey Bread cool off for roughly 10 minutes \u00a0\u00a0 ~CAUTION: the monkey brains will be extremely hot - After 10 minutes has past and the\u00a0bunt pan\u00a0has cooled off place your serving plate ontop of the bunt pan - Carefully flip the entire bunt pan so that it\u00a0is\u00a0upside down sitting on top of your serving plate - To get the Monkey Bread\u00a0out of the plate gently tap on the top of the bunt pan so that it loosens up the Monkey Bread - Once loose simply lift the bunt pan off of the Monkey Bread. - Enjoy!", "images_list": ["monkey-bread-3_0", "monkey-bread-3_1", "monkey-bread-3_2", "monkey-bread-3_3", "monkey-bread-3_4", "monkey-bread-3_6"]}

The garlic has been de-skinned.Now slice each clove of garlic in half, long-ways. Put them in your jar. I counted them as I went and found that I got almost exactly 10 cloves of garlic per head. A little bonus trivia for you. Step 3: Add Brine . <PIC> Pour the brine into your jar until it easily covers the garlic. If you have any rebellious floating cloves, push them down with a chopstick or something else made of wood or plastic. I have heard that metal can negatively react with your fermentation, so you may as well play it safe and leave your metal in the drawer. Step 4: Wait Several Weeks. <PIC> Now just be patient. Fermentation takes at the very minimum several days to a week, but the longer you wait, the better your results and the more numerous and varied your good bacteria. For fermented garlic, the general consensus is to wait 3 to 4 weeks for full maturity.Optional adjustment: Within a week, those rebellious floating cloves from the previous step may keep trying to rise to the surface. These surface cloves have the potential of going bad, so you need to put something on the top to keep the garlic submerged. One option is to fill a baggie with water (or brine, to be safe in case it opens) and lay it on the top to push the garlic down. Another option is some other sort of weight like a sanitized stone or glass. In my case, I started with the first option but then moved the garlic to a bigger jar and pushed the garlic down with a silicon coffee mug topper. Step 5: Eat When Ready!. <PIC> Try the garlic every week or so. When it is to your liking, put it in the refrigerator. It will continue to ferment, but at a much slower pace. It will last in the fridge for a very long time, unless you love it and can't stop eating it!Eat the garlic as is, or chop it up and put it in your salads, dips, or other cold dishes. You can put it in cooked dishes if you want, but you'll lose all that probiotic goodness if you do. For a similar type of dish, try the Instructable I made on Easy Fermented Onions.

Probably not, but this is still a pretty cool way to split an apple. Make sure you tell a big story about how you were trained as a samurai in the ancient art of fingerjitsu when you split it too!  Step 1: Prep the Apple. <PIC> For this step you will need to wash the apple and your hands. Just run the apple under water for a bit and dry it off. Next, firmly grip the stem and twist until it comes out. Step 2: Break the Apple. <PIC> This is the step where the magic happens. After you've told a big story, it's time to show off your moves. Place your index finger on the apple as shown. Make a fist with your other hand. Line up your hands as shown on the apple, and repeatedly hammer your finger into the apple with your fist. To properly do this, you must imagine yourself forcefully pushing your finger through the apple. The key is to not hit your finger many times quickly, but to use a few, strong blows to break the apple in half as shown in the last step. Depending on your apple, this cut may be clean, or not, as it was in my case. With a good apple, you should see that the seed chamber is split almost perfectly in half. Step 3: Serve the Apple. <PIC> Now that you have shown how skilled you are, it is ok to get a knife out to cut the apple. First cut the halves into quarters, then cut out the core as shown. You can then cut the quarters into slices of your preferred thickness, and serve to your friends in a bowl (or eat them yourself.) Thank you for learning how to Split an apple with one finger!

It is really simple and quick and seriously you NEED to try it! Even my dad who is sceptic of cooking meat in the microwave was impressed.  I use quick cooking oats in this recipe (so it can be gluten free!) and I found that by using oats and milk over breadcrumbs and egg it keep the meatloaf wonderfully moist despite being cooked in the microwave.  *To be honest I used oats because I was out of bread and was really hungry XD* But it is delicious!I make this almost weekly and it is great for if friends come over (just double the recipe for 2 of you).  It can also be a quick and impressive meal.This is my base recipe for the meatloaf you can add so much to it to make it taste even better. THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ALMOST ENDLESS!  (Look at the last step for suggestions)I hope that you like it and please let me know if you do! Step 1: Ingredients and Equipment. <PIC> Ingredients:-150g Beef mince (I use low fat mince to be healthier also to have less fat floating on top)- 2 1/2 Teaspoons quick cook oats (if you only have regular oats just put them in a food processor for afew pulses)- 2 1/2 Teaspoons milk ( I used skim milk I don't think it really matters, you could also use water if you have issues with dairy)- 1 Tablespoon ketchup or barbeque sauce + extra for decoration (This depends on your preference I find the barbeque was better for my dad as he said it had a \"Smokey flavour\")- 1/2 Teaspoon garlic powder (can be omitted if you are worried about your breath but if you can KEEP IT IN!!)- 1/4 Teaspoon onion salt- 1/2 Teaspoon salt- 1/2 Teaspoon finely ground pepper (optional but delicious)- Greens to decorateEquipment:- Small bowl- Microwave safe ramekin or mug at least 1 cup capacity- Fork and spoon  Step 2: Make Meat Mix. <PIC> So this recipe could not be simpler (I love easy recipes!). First place your mince in your small bowl and add your quick cook oats and milk.  Then add all the dry seasonings and your preferred sauce.Then with a fork (or spoon) combine all the ingredients together. I use a fork because I find it mushes the ingredients together better, giving a more even meatloaf.The mixture should be very soft at this point.Then transfer the meat mixture into your ramekin or mug. You do not need to grease your ramekin I find that it easily comes out once it is cooked. Step 3: Cook in the Microwave. <PIC> To cook the meat loaf place it in the microwave (mine is 1100 watts) for about 5 minutes. The cooking time will depend on how tall of flat your mixture is in your ramekin.  My 'flatter' ramekin took 5 minutes and 30 seconds to cook all the way through.  Be very careful when removing the meatloaf from the microwave as it will be very hot.If you are worried about undercooked meat and bacteria you can use a meat thermometer to check that it reaches about 75 degrees Celsius (My hard work and researching on Google told me this value). I mainly just check that I use fresh and good quality meat and make sure that the centre is not pink. Step 4: Plate Up and Eat!. <PIC> Allow the meatloaf to cool for a minute as it will be extremely hot.  With your extra sauce you can decorate the top I love putting hearts or smiley faces on my food! I mean who wouldn't love getting food made with love topped off with a love heart?I also find this goes really well with broccoli (I may be broccoli biased) but it also would go lovely with a salad and chips. Step 5: Other Variations. <PIC> As this is my  microwave meatloaf 'base' recipe I suggest you get creative and add other ingredients yourself. Additional ingredients that I have tried and love are- Chives, cheese and onion- Bacon and onion- Mozzarella cheese ball in the centre (So stringy and delicious!)- Grated vegetables like carrot, mushroom and zucchini (make sure you squish out excess water from the vegetables especially zucchini and add extra salt)I hope you feel creative!!", "images_list": ["microwave-meatloaf_0", "microwave-meatloaf_1", "microwave-meatloaf_2", "microwave-meatloaf_3", "microwave-meatloaf_4", "microwave-meatloaf_5"]}

And a few day ago Jenny Flake, from Picky-Palate, asked if I would be interested in posting one of my own recipes as a guest post. First, total excitement hit, followed by panic. I want to start making more of my own recipes, but that hasn't been a huge priority since there are so many recipes I've been wanting to try. So, yesterday was crunch time. Time to make an amazing recipe that would wow everyone. No pressure.\nAnd for all of those who haven't tried to make a recipe, just know it's not horribly easy. Isn't not greatly difficult ether. It just takes a good amount of creativity, but there is a lot more that goes into it then just going by someone else's recipe. A lot of trial and error. Plus after figuring out your ingredients and how to make whatever it is you are making, you have to compose directions to go with your ingredients, and this all needed to get done quickly so I could get back to Jenny and let her know if I even had a recipe I wanted to feature on her blog. Needless to say, it was a long day. Above is the aftermath of nonstop cooking.\nBut, can I just express for a second how hugely excited I am about this recipe. While trying to figure out what it was I wanted to create, it hit me that I've been wanting to feature a Monkey Bread recipe for a while, and it's fall, so the thought pumpkin something kept rolling around in my head. So put the two together and you have Pumpkin Spice Caramel Pecan Monkey Bread. After playing around for a while, it was finally time for the final taste test. Apprehensively I took a bite... My first thought was, \"Wow!! It turned out amazing. Yay!!\" But then I was like, \"After all this hard work, I'm bias.\" so I need someone else's opinion who is just as picky as me. My mom!! I'm not gonna lie, I was even more nerves to have her try my concoction then I was to try it, but she loved it too.

Line an 8X8 square pan with parchment paper. I always find this a little awkward, but it's necessary. I cut two pieces of parchment paper, both a hair less than 8\" so they fit in the pan perfectly.

{"id": "RECIPE_1720", "question": "What\u2019s the best way to prepare delicious deep-fried chicken pot pies from scratch?", "provenance": [41092], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Deep-Fried Chicken Pot Pies. <PIC> The way I see it, the only way to make something like pie taste even better is to deep-fry it. As delicious as a good pot pie it, it only gets better with a little hot oil, so let's hop into the kitchen and deep-fry us some chicken pot pies! Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> \n          This recipe is intended as a way to use up some leftovers. You really do NOT need a large amount of chicken and vegetables to make this and, as leftovers, they are already pre-cooked. You will need:   Cooked chicken, diced, cubed, or shredded (about 1 cup)     Peas (about 1/2 cup)     Carrots (about 1/2 cup)     A small amount of gravy     2 Pie Crusts (your favorite recipe, or from a box)     Optional: Onion, or anything else you like in a pot-pie     One quart (1L) of your favorite deep-frying oil (I used peanut oil)     A heavy/deep pan or pot for the frying     Thermometer, such as a candy thermometer or instant-read infrared thermometer     Heavy Slotted Spoon, Stainless Steel Mesh Basket, or other safe way to place and remove pot-pies from the hot oil.     Optional: a Kitchen Deep-Fry Small Appliance  Dice the carrots. If the peas and carrots are NOT already cooked, quickly cook them for a few minutes in water on the stove-top, then set to the side to cool. Cube, dice, or shred the chicken. It's personal preference whether you want to use white meat, dark meat, or both. Besides leftover chicken, turkey is also excellent. In fact, leftovers from American Thanksgiving are perfect for making these pot-pies, as you are likely to have all of the ingredients, including the pie crusts.\n         Step 2: Prepare the Crust. <PIC> Next, prepare the crust. You can use your favorite family recipe or a box from the store. In my case the family recipe IS using the box from the store. No joke, my mother makes a nearly world-famous cherry pie, but the dark little secret is a \"just add water\" crust mix from the grocery store. Mix the dough, then divide in half, and roll out two 9-inch pie crusts. Cut each crust in half, for a total of four pieces of half-circle dough. Set three of them off to the side, and then place one in front of you along with the filling ingredients to prepare for assembly. Step 3: Assemble. <PIC> \n          Actually making the pot-pie is very straight-forward - add the ingredients and then fold over the crust.   Place pieces of chicken on ONE SIDE of the crust     Add Peas     Add Carrots     Spoon a SMALL amount of gravy over the top of the other ingredients     Wet the perimeter of the pie crust     Fold the pie crust over onto itself and seal shut  Make sure to start with the ingredients just on the one side, leaving enough space on the edge to seal the crust. DO NOT OVERSTUFF! Put less of the ingredients in than you think you will need. It is easy to add too much, which will make it difficult to seal the crust, or have the crust split. Place the pot pies on a plate in the refrigerator for just a few minutes to firm up the crust while you clean up and get the oil ready for deep-frying.\n         Step 4: Fry. <PIC> \n          Deep-frying is likely one of the most delicious, and dangerous, things you can do in the kitchen. As such, pay attention to your work, and never leave hot oil unattended. To fry, you need a deep pan or \"dutch oven\". Cast iron is ideal. Select one that is large enough for the pot-pies to fit (one at a time.) It's best not to use too large of a diameter pan, as you will need so much more oil to fill it. I chose an eight-inch diameter cast iron pan. It's big enough, but minimizes oil needed. Fill the pan an inch to an inch and inch and a half deep with oil. The oil should be deep enough to just cover the top of the pot-pie, and still be well below the rim of the pan. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F. (177C) Check the oil temperature as it heats. Do not leave the oil unattended. Once the oil is to temperature, you are ready to fry the first pie. Gently place the pot-pie into the oil. Lower it in using a wire basket, slotted spoon, or other appropriate utensil that will confidently hold the pot-pie and keep your hands and fingers away from the oil. I had a tongs/wire whisk tool that worked well for this. Fry the pie for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown, flipping it over at 1 to 1.5 minutes into the frying. Remove the pot-pie from the fryer. Place the pie on a plate that has been covered with several paper towels to absorb any extra oil. Monitor your oil temperature. It will drop a bit after the first pie. Adjust your heat as needed to maintain the 350 degree temperature. Repeat with the other three pies. Turn off the heat. Do not move the pan. Allow it to sit until cooled to room temperature while you go eat delicious deep-fried pot-pies. A Few Notes on SAFETY:    Small children can help make the pies, but keep them out of the kitchen once hot oil is involved.     In the event of a grease fire, do NOT throw water on it!     The safest way to put out a grease fire in a pot or pan is to place a tight-fitting lid on top, smothering the flames.     Always keep a fire extinguisher in your home and especially your kitchen. Just make sure it is rated for extinguishing \u00a0\"Type B -\u00a0Liquid\" fires.     Make sure to monitor oil temperature. Many oils begin to smoke around 450 degrees.     Do NOT fill the pan too high with oil. Make sure there's enough room for waves, splashing, and the volume consumed by the food, without the oil going over the edge of the pot.     Do NOT move the frying pan until it has completely cooled down. Even if it is on fire. Especially if it is on fire.     Deep-fryer kitchen appliances are a good idea in that they contain the hot oil, have a full lid, are very deep, etc. They ARE\u00a0safer than using oil in a frying pan. If you deep fry on a regular basis, you may want to consider purchasing one.     If possible, deep-fry outdoors, away from buildings. Thats's how turkey deep-frying is done. It would also be SO much fun to do that while at a camp-ground\u2026.     Do not touch Happy Fun Ball.  Step 5: Eat. <PIC> \n          This recipe makes four (4) personal-sized deep-fried chicken pot-pies. I don't know exactly how many calories or grams of fat is in each serving, but if you are making deep-fried pies, YOU probably don't want to know either. Pot-pies are good served with a side of stuffing or cranberry sauce. You could also provide a small dish of gravy to go on the side as well. These pot-pies taste great and you can stuff them with whatever fillings you would like. As a fun variation, try making them with \"Puff Pastry\". Have fun, be safe, and enjoy the meal! If you enjoy my kitchen experiments, check out some of the others, like baking bread in a Crock-Pot, here on Instructables, or at my blog, EcoProjecteer.net! Take care, -Ben Other thoughts, notes, and lessons learned:    I would NOT re-use the oil after making pot-pies. They tend to leave lots of particles behind. However, it's fine to use lightly used oil to cook the pies in. I had already made a batch of deep-fried apple pies, and then re-used the oil for the pot-pies.     While my frying pan worked well, it would still be nice to use an even deeper vessel to heat the oil in. I have a black iron dutch oven I use for camping, and I think I'll try using that next time. The dis-advantage of a deeper container is that you have to use a different style utensil to place and remove the pies. Either a wire-basket or \"dipper\"-shaped utensil would be needed.     If you are making a number of pot-pies, and want to keep them warm until all are made, you can hold the\u00a0fried pies in a 200 degree oven.     Fried foods don't reheat well. Make the amount you want, and then eat them all right away. You can reheat in the oven to try to get some crispness back, but it's just not the same.  PS: Once you are confident in your deep-fried pie skills, why not try deep-fried FRUIT pies, or other delicious hot desserts!\n        ", "images_list": ["deep-fried-chicken-pot-pies_0", "deep-fried-chicken-pot-pies_1", "deep-fried-chicken-pot-pies_2", "deep-fried-chicken-pot-pies_3", "deep-fried-chicken-pot-pies_4", "deep-fried-chicken-pot-pies_5"]}

Unfortunately, between taking them out of the oven and taking a photo, quite a few had already been \"sampled\". An unavoidable consequence, it seems, and when planning how many to make, attrition should be taken into account. Step 1: Step 1 - Make Mashed Potatoes. <PIC> This recipe calls for about 1/2-1 cup of unseasoned mashed potatoes. To do this, take one or two smallish potatoes, peel and slice, and boil until soft enough to easily break with a spoon. Drain the water, and mash. Step 2: Step 2 - Add Ingredients. <PIC> I'm lazy, so I'm using a breadmaker, but it's just as easy to do this in a bowl by hand.\nIn a breadmaker, the main difference is that you need to add the yeast last, and the liquids/liquid-like ingredients first. Make sure that if you do it in a breakmaker you use the \"pasta\" cycle. You won't be letting this dough rise right now, it rises slowly in the refrigerator overnight instead, producing a very soft texture.\nThe ingredients to add are:\n1. 1/2-1 package of active dry yeast (1.5tsp)\n2. 3/4 cup of warm water\n3. 1/2-1 cup of mashed potatoes\n4. 1/3 cup sugar\n5. 1/3 cup butter or crisco\n6. 1-2 eggs\n7. 3/4 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt\n8. 3-4 cups of flour\nMix together in a bread mixer, or if by hand, let the yeast rise in the water briefly and then knead the ingredients together. Step 3: Step 3 - Raise and Bake. <PIC> Put the dough into an oiled bowl and cover tightly. Put in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, and as long as 5 days. When done, take the dough, punch down, and split into 1\" balls. Place the balls in a dish so that they were touching. Let the dough rise for at least an hour, probably as long as four. Next, bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Brush with softened butter before baking for a stronger flavor.\nTo make crescent rolls, roll out about half the dough into a circular round.

A cup of bold, dark coffee layered with creamy milk and a hint of sweet caramel is reason enough to get up in the morning. More specifically, a Dulce de Leche Latte will wake up your senses. And I'm going to make one right now. A latte is simply 3 parts milk to one part of espresso. And you can add many different flavors to spice it up. Using freshly roasted coffee beans and grinding them right before you use them, will give you that distinct flavor and aroma. First I'm going to steam my milk. When you direct pressured steam through milk, it changes the protein properties inside and forms these thousands of little tiny air bubbles that give you the steamed milk as well as a fluffy layer of foam on top. It also turns the milk sweet and delicious! Remember to use fresh and cold milk every time, and only steam the amount you need. I filled my milk pitcher and now i'll place the steam wand inside the pitcher until it's submerged. With the steam on full blast, I move the pitcher up and down until it gets warm.\u00a0 I'm adding foam to the milk. See the milk spinning around like a whirlpool? The trick in steaming milk is to be patient with it. When it gets warm, I stop aerating it and then continue heating up until the side of the pitcher is too hot to touch. That's when I know my milk is ready. Now it's time for the espresso. You can play with the coarseness and grind amount to determine the boldness of flavor. I like mine on the darker, bolder side, so i'm going to put it on a coarse grind. I'm filling up my portafilter just to the edge. A portafilter carries the grounds in its basket, and attaches to the machine before water is pressured through to give you your espresso shot. So once i fill the portafilter with the coffee grounds, i tamp it firmly, about 30 pounds of weight, so that the surface is flat, compacted, and smooth. Now I attach the portafilter to the machine and let the infusion begin! You can see the thick espresso pouring out followed by a blonde crema. But now we need to act fast before the crema breaks down and the flavor loses intensity. Now i'm pouring the espresso into a mug and adding a tablespoon of vanilla syrup. Next, i'm pouring the milk into the middle of the cup, slowly, while holding back the foam with a spoon. The espresso and milk will start mixing together. When the cup is almost full, I pour the milk in a little faster until a foam starts to appear. Then I finish by scooping the foam out with my spoon until it looks like I have a little cloud in my cup. I drizzle some of the dulce de leche on top of the foam, and that's it -- the perfect latte. Totally delicious. Thanks to Breville for providing the Breville Barista Express!", "images_list": []}

Cakes, cookies, muffins, to name a few. But did you know that the vanilla extract in your kitchen is made up of at least 35% alcohol?  This is because alcohol is wonderful in extracting the flavor from herbs and botanics, and vanilla beans are no exception. However, if for whatever reason, you cannot or do not want so much alcohol in your vanilla extract, there is an alternative!Slightly thicker in viscosity, alcohol-free vanilla extract is a perfect substitute to add into all your favorite baked goods. But if not alcohol, then what? Our surrogate will be Vegetable Glycerin! Let's get started steeping! Step 1: Materials. <PIC> For this project, you will need:a paring knife (fancy word for small knife)3 vanilla beans12 ounce glass container for storage  10 ounces of vegetable glycerin (via online retailers or Whole Foods)Note on vegetable glycerin: please make sure it is food grade, if you are unsure ask an expert. I used Now Solutions 100% pure Vegetable Glycerin that is fine to consume internally as well as externally as a multi-purpose moisturizer. What exactly is vegetable glycerin? It is made from vegetable oil and is a by-product of soap manufacturing. The FDA has classified it as a carbohydrate. Its wonderfully popular in foods because of it's sweet taste and the fact that it has less calories than sugar, but for topical use, glycerin absorbs moisture from the air around it. Pretty magical stuff, really. Because of this, glycerin in any form, either animal or vegetable is a great substitute for alcohol in botanical extractions and herbal essences. Let's get started! Step 2: Preparing Beans. <PIC> Take three standard-length vanilla beans and cut them lengthwise down the center. Take one half and open it  so the tiny pods are have more surface area to be extracted by the glycerin. Place all 3 halves (or six total) lengths of bean and place them into a glass container.  Step 3: Adding Glycerin. <PIC> Pour in 10 ounces of your vegetable glycerin into the glass container. Close lid, and shake slightly to make sure beans are well incorporated  Step 4: Steeping. <PIC> Allow your vanilla beans to steep in the glycerin for a minimum of 8 weeks, after that you can use some of it and allow the rest to continue to steep, or use it all. The best thing about the vanilla beans is that you can reuse them in another cycle of gylcerin steeping. After about two uses, though, I would recommend using new beans because their potency may wane. Enjoy!

Step 1: . <PIC> Select a piece of dental floss at least 9 inches longer than the diameter of the cake you are cutting (e.g., for a 9-inch round cake, about 18 inches). Wrap the ends around your index fingers and position the floss at the level you want to cut through the cake. (In the picture below, I wanted so slice the frosted dome off the cupcake.) Step 2: . <PIC> Pull the floss through the cake, using steady, even pressure. Keep the floss level.\u00a0 Step 3: . <PIC> Finish pulling the floss through the cake, and you're done!\u00a0 In the picture below, the cut is a little slanted, because I didn't hold the floss perfectly level. If this is a problem, you can tie one end of the string to some kind of implement (chopstick, pencil, etc.) and only move the other end. Also, cakes without items baked into them cut more cleanly, because there is nothing for the floss to get caught on (like the shredded carrots in the carrot cake cupcake).\u00a0", "images_list": ["how-to-level-a-cake-using-dental-floss_0", "how-to-level-a-cake-using-dental-floss_1", "how-to-level-a-cake-using-dental-floss_2", "how-to-level-a-cake-using-dental-floss_3"]}

We were. We did the usual little figurines and so on, but that was a bit dull. Then - brainwave - what's both gross and delicious? Chocolate finger-tips.\nUsing Pinky-sil silicone, fingers, and chocolate, you can offer your friends a unique Easter chocolate. Step 1: Make the Moulds. <PIC> Do the usual mould making - 1:1 mix of silicon, or whatever your stuff says. I used little plastic bottles as the formwork for the mould, didn't want to waste too much silicon. Egg cups would do, I guess, though you want something that will stand up as the chocolate sets.\nI got my kids to use their fingers, but knowing they would wriggle around they set themselves up with books to read as the silicon takes about 20 mins to go off, longer if it is cold.\nOnce the silicon is set, it is not hard to get the fingers out; harder to get the moulds out of the forms. Make a little hole in the bottom of the forms, so air can get in as you lever/wriggle/ squeeze them out. Step 2: Trim and Prepare. <PIC> Trim the moulds, and check for any leaks where fingers may have touched the formwork - you'll need to patch these. Then get your chocolate sorted. Thanks to the excellent Scoochmaroo, who sent us wonderful chocolate, all the way to Kabul, we were able to do something really special. Thanks again! (and she didn't even know us!). Step 3: Make Fingers. <PIC> Pour your fingers. Make sure you shake and squeeze the chocolate down into the mould. We decided to put little toothpick-y things in them, both to add a handy handle and to possible insert the fingers later into, say, a cake.\nKids loved it, even though I got a bit terse as they (inevitably) wiggled as the silicon was settling\u2026. but this is about involvement and creativity, not perfection.\nI imagine these could look more realistic by blending in white chocolate. I suppose you could paint the nail too, with some kind of thin icing\u2026 dunno.

Vacuum forming is easy and fun!!!Lets make some cool chocolate moulds!Check out the video first =) Step 1: Let's Make a Box!. <PIC> To make a chocolate mould we need to assemble a vacuum forming table. Vacuum sheet forming is the simplest and least expensive of all thermoforming processes. A sheet of hot plastic is is blown in to a bubble and then sucked onto the surface of the form.A vacuum forming table basically is a simple box with some holes on top to create a suction area. To make this box I\u2019m using:A sheet of 2x2 feet MDF, 1/4\u201d thickness and two poplar boards 1\u201dx3\u201dx2feet.As a reference for my table dimensions I used a letter size sheet of paper. I used a 45 degree miter joint to create my box, but you can use any joinery method for your box. As long as you have straight corners you will be fine.Cut your top and bottom panels to the size of your frame. The top panel will be our suction area, so we need to make some holes there. I marked a grid to drill my holes so they are approximately an inch apart from each other.After I drilled all my holes (including a hole on the side of the frame for my vacuum connection) I attached my panels to the frame with some drywall screws.The box is done. Step 2: Making a Mould. <PIC> From the same piece of MDF I made a frame to hold up the plastic sheet. I've attached the plastic sheet to it with binder clips. The more binder clips the better the edges of the form will hold the shape.But before we put plastic in the oven, we need to create a razed support for our frame there, so we have space for hot plastic to stretch down. I put 4 ceramic bowls in the oven to create a support for each corner of the frame.For plastic I'm using a food safe PET plastic, 0.5mm thick . Preheat your oven to a 350F. Don't forget to use oven mittens then you working with hot stuff. Put your frame with mounted plastic sheet on it  in the oven for about a minute or two. Get the frame out of the oven as soon as the plastic sags 2-3 inches below the frame level. Put it over the running suction table. And in seconds the plastic magically will be shaped around your object.It takes some practice, and depending on your plastic you will need to play with the heat settings. Step 3: Chocolate Time!. <PIC> Melt some chocolate chips or baking chocolate in a double boiler. Pour it in the mould and put it in the fridge to cool down. Super easy!Now you know how to make an awesome custom chocolate. You can use different objects to create the form. It would make a great present or a sweet treat for yourself. =) Step 4: Enjoy!.

I.E. My box was 9 3/4 inches wide so i measured out 3 equal segments of around 3 1/4 inches.  (in the end, each 'cell' with the added width of the dividers were exactly 2 3/4 inches wide and were a perfect fit for a tea bag.)  If you want to make an organizer that holds the tea bags at an angle, you have to put a segment of dowel running along the bottom of the box left to right in order to make 2 'stops' for the tea bags.  Then, a dowel must be cut that runs up and down in the box to separate the two sides, creating 4 'cells' Step 2: Measure and Cut. <PIC> Take your wooden dowel, whatever shape you may have, and cut it to the lengths you need.  I needed two segments to make three cells in my flat organizer and two longer segments to make the layers of my tilted organizer. IMPORTANT: many cigar boxes come with 4 thin wall inserts that are up against the inner wall of the box. These are there to help the box close more snugly and stay closed. Remove these before measuring and gluing in your dowels because they are not secured to the box in any way and will move eventually. You can remove these inserts and use them as dividers if you don't want to measure and cut any dowels to length seeing as they are perfectly fit for the box already. Secure your wooden dowel on a workbench using a vice or two for easier cutting.  Use whatever saw works best for you!  For a nice touch, i sanded down the long edges of the dowels that face upwards for a smooth finish  and for aesthetic purposes (you can choose to stain your dowels/dividers if you'd like.)  Step 3: Final Measurements and Glue. <PIC> Take your dowels, lay them in position, and make sure that they are equidistant from each other using your ruler/measuring tape (if you're doing a symmetrical one like mine).  Once you have them in the desired position, mark their location using a pencil on the walls of the box.  Now you can use any sort of glue. but i had gorilla glue on hand so that is what i used.  Apply a generous amount of glue to the bottom and ends of the dowel (any part that will be touching a wall or the bottom of the box) and press it into place using your pencil marks.  Press down with force to ensure that the dowels are seated properly and that there are no air pockets between the two pieces of wood.  Wipe away all excess glue from the edges of the dowel if any seeps out. I placed a couple of heavy candles on top of the dowels as they were drying to make the best possible seal. Step 4: You're Finished!. <PIC> Let the glue dry a full 24 hours for good measure and then stuff the organizer with tea bags of your choice!  Later on i will be decorating my organizers with custom labels so people aren't confused by the cigar labels.  I hope you've enjoyed this 'ible!  Leave a comment if you have a question, concern, or if you want to show off your own custom organizer.  The possibilities are endless because of the many shapes and sizes of cigar boxes to use and the different ways to configure your tea bags.

This can work for any drink you make be it cans of frozen orange juice concentrate or other concentrate, a pitcher of flavor crystal drink mix or any kind of recreational beverage.\u00a0 My passion for drinking cold drinks spouted from my friend's martini shaker and the lack of my owning one, it seems as if they are in scarce supply in my area as the shaker without any other fuzz n fluff.\u00a0 So I've been needing more n more mcgyver (red green in Canada) solutions to my warm drink problem.\u00a0 This is my latest solution. Step 1: Preparation. <PIC> Now I'm going to assume you're in a pinch like I just was on my quest for a tasty cold beverage and only tap water at my arsenal.\u00a0 If you were in my situation without ice making you one sad panda and some messy roommates you're going to assume these freezies you have found in the freezer are not clean.\u00a0 Step one in preparation: \u00a0 Come to terms with the fact that you need you're roommate alive to continue paying their part of the rent and that empty icecube trays isn't too bad a problem.Step Two: Dig for those freezies you saw berried in that freezer.Step Three: Get them covered in soap and rubbed down with this soap.Step four: Rinse them off with you're coldest available water source.\u00a0 Warm water will obviously not serve this purpose.\u00a0 *this step is essential as you probably don't know what could be dripped all over those delicious frozen icetubes.Step five: just make sure that soaps gone because you're drink will be ruined otherwise.

{"id": "RECIPE_1798", "question": "What is the process for creating delicious vegan root beer float cupcakes that capture that classic summer treat?", "provenance": [41137], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Vegan Root Beer Float Cupcakes. <PIC> Now that the summer has come, I have sweet treats on the brain (not that I don\u2019t usually!). One of my favorites is root beer floats. I love the ice cream slightly melting, the fizz that bubbles in your nose and of course, the cherry on top.\nThis cupcake has just the right amount of root beer flavor with smooth vanilla frosting complete with cherry and straw. Also, they\u2019re so adorable I can\u2019t stand it. they don\u2019t take a lot of decorating skills either!\nYour secret weapon for these is going to be root beer extract (or concentrate). Step 1: Bake Your Cupcakes. <PIC> Root Beer Float Cupcakes\n1 Cup plus 2 tablespoons Root Beer Soda\n1 Teaspoon Apple Cider Vinegar\n3/4 Cup Granulated Sugar\n1/3 Cup Canola or Vegetable Oil\n1/2 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract\n2 Teaspoons Root Beer Extract (You can get this at the grocery store, not too hard to find)\n1 1/3 Cups All-Purpose Flour\n1/2 Teaspoon Baking Powder\n3/4 Teaspoon Baking Soda\nPour root beer and apple cider vinegar into blender and let sit for three-ish minutes. Dump remainder of ingredients in blender and blend until smooth.\nYou should be able to pour the batter out without the aid of a spoon, but it shouldn\u2019t be loose and runny. If the batter is too thick add in more root beer one tablespoon at a time, checking the consistency after each. If the batter is too runny, add just a bit more flour.\nLine muffin pans and fill each 3/4 full. Bake at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes.\nTake cupcakes out to cool for 10 minutes or so then transfer to a separate plate. Also, when you take your cupakes out, never be afraid to stick a toothpick in them to see if they\u2019re done. If you\u2019re worried about leaving a hole in the cupcakes, don\u2019t. It\u2019s going to be covered in frosting anyway. Step 2: Make Your Frosting. <PIC> Vanilla Fizz Frosting\n1 Cup Vegetable Shortening\n3 Cups Confectioner\u2019s Sugar\n2 Tablespoons Plain Soymilk\n1 1/2 Teaspoons Vanilla Extract\n1/2 Teaspoon Root Beer Extract\nBeat the shortening with a hand mixer on low until creamy. Add in confectioner\u2019s sugar a half a cup at a time and beat together. Add in soymilk, vanilla extract and root beer extract and beat until frosting is fluffy.\nSide note: This makes a TON of frosting. If you want big heaping clouds, it\u2019s perfect, if you want an amount that won\u2019t send you into diabetic shock, cut the recipe in half.\nThe root beer extract isn\u2019t overpower in the frosting so don\u2019t be nervous about adding it. It gives it more of a light brown color, the way fizz looks on top of a root beer float.\u00a0 Step 3: Decorate With Frosting. <PIC> Now, to decorate the cupcakes. You can either pipe the frosting on, or you can slap a pile of it and smooth with your finger. I will say you can\u2019t really spread this frosting on with a knife.\nI personally hate piping, and if you think about it, the fizz on a root beer float is definitely not ornately made flower petals and pearly dots. It\u2019s bubbly. I opted for the finger technique.\nBecause the frosting uses shortening, it won\u2019t stick to dry fingers. So all you have to do is scoop a pile of frosting on the cupcake and pat with your finger. Don\u2019t worry if there are little air bubbles that pop and leave pock marks on the frosting, honestly, it looks more like fizz (I know, I know\u2026 you\u2019re thinking what is with this girl and root beer float fizz).\nI do suggest piping a tiny dollop of frosting on the top of the cupcakes. This is where you will put the cherry. Step 4: The Finishing Touches. <PIC> Speaking of cherries\u2026 Take twelve maraschino cherries from the jar and lay them on a paper towel. You will need to pat them dry so that the juice doesn\u2019t run all over your cupcake or make your frosting loose.\nWhile you are waiting for the cherries to dry, take out twelve bendy straws and a pair of scissors. I promise, I won\u2019t get too arts and craftsy on you!\nCut the straws to a good length, you want about 3/4 to an inch of straw between the cupcake top and the bendy part. I trimmed a little off the top of the straw too, just to it didn\u2019t look out of proportion.\nStick the straws in the cupcakes off to one side. If you make jumbo cupcakes, use two straws and put one on each side. (You\u2019re almost done!!)\nNow take your dry cherries and place one on each cupcake on the dollop of frosting. And voila!

{"id": "RECIPE_1810", "question": "What\u2019s the best way to create a delicious rashmalai dessert from scratch?", "provenance": [41144], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Rashmalai (Dessert). <PIC> This is a fun dessert recipe. Why? Because... it's a 3 in 1 dessert! Rashmalai is a popular sweet dish in the South Asian countries. To make Rashmalai you have to make Rashgolla, which is also a very popular sweet dish. To make Rashgolla you will need to make 'Chaana' (curdled milk), which is also served as dessert in various forms. Chaana is used to make a number of sweet dishes such as- rashgolla, rashmalai, shandesh, chomchom etc (these are popular sweet dishes in South Asian countries). Anyways, it takes a while (10-15 hours!) to prepare this dessert and it's worth the waiting so give it a try. Step 1: Ingredients. To make Rashamalai you will have to make curdled milk, then rashgolla and finally rashmalai. Ingredients of each recipe has been listed below.Curdled milk:Fresh milk - 1 liter, White vinegar - 4 tbsp, Water - 4 tbsp.Rashgolla:Sugar - 1 cup, Cardamom - 2-3, All purpose flour - 1 tbsp.Rashmalai:Fresh milk - 0.5 liter, Sugar - 1 tbsp. Step 2: Curdled Milk (Chaana). <PIC> Add 1 liter milk in a pot and mix 4 tbsp of white vinegar with 4 tbsp of water in a cup.Heat milk and bring to boil.As soon as the milk starts to boil add the white vinegar-water mixture to the milk and take the milk off from the cooker. In just a few seconds the milk will become curdled. Wait for 5 minutes.Use a filter spoon to filter the curdled milk from the water,Try to filter as much water as possible.Keep the curdled milk in a dry place for 2-3 hours. Step 3: Making Curdled Milk Balls. <PIC> Add 1 tbsp of all purpose flour, 1 tbsp of sugar and 0.25 tsp of cardamom powder to the curdled milk (chaana).Mix and knead them really well.Make equally sized balls (the size of the balls depend on your choice). I made 20.Place the curdled milk balls on a flat plate while preparing the sugar syrup. Step 4: Making Rashgolla. <PIC> Add 2.5 cups of water and 1 cup of sugar in a sauce pan,Heat the sugar and water until the sugar is dissolved and bring to boil,As soon as the sugar syrup starts boiling bring heat to low.Pour the curdled milk balls into the sugar syrup one by one carefully,Keep them on low heat for 8-10 minutes (not more than 10 minutes),Now, take the sauce pan off from heat and cool them. Keep them in the sugar syrup for an hour.The chaana balls are kept in the sugar syrup if you want to serve them as Rashgolla but since we're making Rashmalai we'll filter the syrup from the chaana balls and keep them in a dry place while preparing the malai.

So I thought I'd share a candy-inspired frappuccino recipe. This Peanut Butter Cup Frappuccino emulates these delicious peanut-buttery treats: Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and Reese's Pieces.I've only come across one Starbucks secret recipe version for this, but since Starbucks has limited syrups, it doesn't appear to come out right. That version mixes Toffee Nut and Caramel, but since I found Peanut Butter Torani at the store, I just went with that :) Step 1: Supplies. <PIC> This recipe is a single serving and makes about the equivalent of a 16oz Grande from Starbucks.Ingredients:2c ice1/4c strong coffee1/2c milk - or half & half or whipping cream1-2 tbsp chocolate sauce - Torani's Chocolate Milano Syrup is also an option3-4 tbsp Peanut Butter Syrup - see note below about using actual Peanut Butter2 tbsp Simple Syrup - more or less to tastePinch of  Xantham Gum (optional)I did 1 tbsp chocolate and 3 tbsp peanut butter and at first it seemed a bit weak, but got stronger as the drink melted, so I wanted to put a range in case you want it stronger and/or you want more of one flavor or another.

I have done this before and it works, but it changes the texture of the drink because of the Peanut Butter. My husband preferred it this way and compared it to the texture of a protein shake.Add-insYou could cut up/mash up Reese's peanut butter cups (probably 1 to 3 would do like I did with the Oreos in my Oreo Frappuccino) or Reese's pie es and blend them in with the drink. Probably be similar to using chocolate chips like in my Double Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino.Utensils:Blender - I use a Magic Bullet at home, it's great for making individual drinks though doesn't blend quite as well as the VitamixIce cube trays - small ice cubes make for even easier blendingMeasuring cups and spoonsCups for servingStraws Step 2: Blend. <PIC> Time to mix up all of your ingredients.

We've found that pizza from scratch isn't that difficult and tastes way better. Try for yourself and see! Step 1: Dry Stuff. <PIC> To make two 14\" pizzas, measure 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I've made with all white flour and it's fine. Stir in 1 Tbs dry yeast and a small handful of flaxseed meal. Step 2: Making the Dough. <PIC> Measure 1 cup of milk (if you like making cheese, this is an excellent use for whey), and 2 Tbs olive oil.  Microwave the milk or whey for 1 minute, add the olive oil to the milk then pour it into the dry mix and stir until combined.  Step 3: Knead. <PIC> Once the dough is combined, spoon it out onto a well floured surface. I do it right on my pizza peel. Knead for 5 minutes working a little flour in if necessary. After five minutes you should have less stress and a nice ball of dough (win-win).  Place it in a floured bowl, cover with a clean towel and put in a warm spot for 30-60 minutes.  The warm milk makes it rise pretty fast.  Step 4: Assembly. <PIC> After rising, drag a knife through the middle to divide the dough in half. Flour the pizza peel and roll out half the dough. I roll for a bit then pick it up, add flour to the peel and roll a little more. You do not want the dough to stick to the peel.  Start heating your oven to 425F with your baking surface in there. It's very important to heat your pizza stone with the oven. I've had stones and tiles, I currently use a cast iron pizza pan made by Lodge and love it.  Step 5: Ingredients. <PIC> At this point it's up to you.  The pics show tomato pizza sauce, mozzarella, ham and pineapple. We've done all sorts of pizza toppings. I especially like browsing through leftovers and improvising. Baking time depends on how crispy you like it, I just keep checking until it looks done.  In a pinch the whole process can be complete in an hour or less. If you have time, it's great fun to have the kids pitch in and put their own toppings on.

Roll out the dough gently to a thickness of between 1/4 and 1/8 inch depending on your preference.

These are great for a tasty cool treat in summer, but you can\u2019t recycle the container.  Here is an idea to make a frozen drink using small bottles that you would otherwise toss in the recycling bin. Step 1: . <PIC> You will need:A quantity of small plastic bottles Recipe ingredients (recipe at end)4 Quart saucepanFunnelMeasuring cup with pouring lipStrawsThe number of bottles you will need depends on the size of the bottles you saved from the recycler and whether or not you are going to add soda to the bottle when serving.  I ended up using 12 (10 oz) plastic water bottles.   I don\u2019t recommend glass bottles because of the danger of the bottle shattering if filled too full. (The plastic bottle will also shatter if filled too full, but I\u2019d rather deal with plastic shards if I make a mistake than glass shards.) Step 2: . <PIC> Bring the water and sugar to a boil in the saucepan.  Add the concentrates and mix well.  Turn off the heat once the sugar has dissolved.  Once the liquid is  cool enough to handle.  (You should be able to stick your finger in the liquid without saying bad words), add the alcohol.   I know the picture shows me just dumping in the bottle, but I was just kidding, measure it.  Too much alcohol and it won\u2019t freeze properly, too little and it will take forever to thaw. Step 3: . <PIC> After you add the rum and brandy, use a pitcher or measuring cup with a pour spout and funnel to fill bottles about \u00bd to 2/3 full. Place in freezer.  (Man, I need to defrost that thing)  Take out of the freezer about 10 to 15 minutes before serving.  Stick in a straw and add soda if you like (at most of the parties I attended, parents drank the straight slush and the kids finished off the soda).  If you are taking these to a friend\u2019s party, toss them in a cooler and they should be fine when you arrive.  The recipe mentions a variation with alcohol soaked fruit.  This would be fine if you are using wide mouthed bottles, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it if the bottles you are using have a small opening. Step 4: . <PIC> I adapted this recipe from one I found years ago in one of those supermarket recipe booklets that you find by the checkout.Slush3 cups water\u00be cup sugar36 oz frozen drink concentrate, your choice of flavors1 pint Rum1 pint BrandyLemon Lime SodaBring water and sugar to a boil (3 minutes).

Mix in glass with lemon lime drink.Variation:  I like to soak fruit in alcohol and add it to the container when partially frozen.  If you add it too soon, it will just sink down to the bottom.

{"id": "RECIPE_1862", "question": "What are the key steps involved in dismantling a whole chicken at home for optimal use?", "provenance": [41177], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Dismantle a Chicken. <PIC> As a recovering vegetarian, I am always learning all sorts of new meat related skills. Most people probably already know how to do this, but I had to look it up, so I figured there would be other meat newbies like me who could use the instructable.\nI started buying whole chickens and dismantling them myself to save some money. The more slices a butcher does for you, the more money you pay. Not only do you get more meat for your buck, but you can use the valuable bones for making your own chicken stock. So here is how to take apart a whole chicken, neatly, in about 5 minutes.\nI am doing two at a time here so don't be confused when you suddenly see 4 chicken wings. It's not a mutant chicken, they were just on sale!Hardware:\n- 1 very sharp chef's or boning knife\n- Clean cutting board\n- Bowl or ziplock bag for the meatSoftware:\n- 1 whole chickenMethod:\nSeparate the wings. Cut in half, and remove the tips.\nRemove the legs by slicing between body and thigh, popping the hip bone, and removing it.\nSeparate thigh from drumstick by cutting cleanly through the middle joint.\nRemove the breasts by slicing them off of breast bone.\nCut carcass in half and use for soup stock! Step 1: The Wings. <PIC> With the chicken breast side down, hold up the wing and make a slice just underneath it to reveal the joint. Slice cleanly through the joint. Repeat with the other wing.\nIf you're cooking the wing, you can remove the nubbin. There's very little to eat on it and they usually burn anyway. I set mine aside for making soup stock later.\nIf you'd like, separate the wing into 2 sections by cutting clean through the joint at the elbow.  Step 2: The Legs. <PIC> To remove the legs, flip the chicken over so it's breast side up.\nPull the leg away from the body and slice through the skin between the body and both sides of the thigh.\nBend the whole leg firmly away from the body until you see the ball of the thigh bone pops from the hip socket.\u00a0 Cut between the ball and the socket to separate the leg.\nRepeat with the other leg.\nYou can separate the thigh and drumstick by cutting firmly through the joint between the drumstick and the thigh.  Step 3: The Breast. <PIC> There's a few ways to do the breast, but I like to keep from slicing through the bones as much as possible.\nI bring my knife to the side of the beast, where you can see it connects with the breastbone.\nSlice along the bone cleanly, following the shape of the breast. As you come to the middle, stop.\nBring your knife up over the breast, and slice along the middle to separate the breast.\nThis saves having to much around with cutting through the rib cage and connective tissues, but it does run the risk of leaving more meat on the bone. Repeat on the other side.  Step 4: The Rest. <PIC> There, you now have a whole chicken separated neatly into wings, thighs, drumstick and breasts.\nNow you have cleaned the meat from the bones, you also have a chicken carcass left over.\nYou can toss it in the garbage (sacrilege!), cut it in half and use it to make soup stock, freeze it for later, or voodoo up yourself an army of walking chicken skeletons.

Ingredients: 1 5 lb bag of flour1 3 pack of active dry yeast 5 cups of milk1 stick of buttera pinch of salt Step 1: Prepare Your Milk. <PIC> Heat the milk in a sauce pan, and add the stick of butter.  Stir until the butter is completely melted into milk, turn off the heat and allow to cool.   It is very important the milk is room temperature before moving on to the next step.  Ice can be added to aid in the cooling process, but be careful not to chill beyond room temp.  Step 2: Prepare for Mixing. <PIC> Add the entire 5 lb bag of flour into a large mixing bowl and create a crater in the center of the flour.  Pour the milk mix into the center of the flour.  Verify that the mix is no longer hot from the cooking. (if the milk is too hot it will kill the yeast).  Cut each of the 3 packets open in the yeast pack and pour into the mix of milk/butter.  Step 3: Mixing the Dough. <PIC> Spoon the yeast to mix it in, then using your hands break up any clumps to distribute the yeast throughout the milk.  Allow the mixture to set for 10-15 minutes to allow the yeast to activate.  Using your hands pull the flour edges down into the milk, and begin to mix the dough.  Work the dough with your hands to mix all dry flour into liquid mix.  The dough should start to become consistent in form.  If the dough is still too sticky(sticking to your hands) after about five minutes of mixing then add flour until the dough no longer sticks to your hands.  If the dough becomes flaky or doesn't not hold together you added to much.  In this case add water until you the mix is evenly mixed and the dough does not stick to your hands.  Kneed the dough for up to ten minutes or until the dough is consistently mixed.  Take the dough ball out of the bowl, and grease the edges of the pan to prevent sticking during the rising.  Put the dough back into the bowl and cover.  let it rest/rise for 45 minutes.  Step 4: Punch the Dough Down. <PIC> After 45 minutes has passed the dough should have risen to twice its size.  Punch down the dough and allow it to rest.  After resting cut the dough into chunks that will fill a loaf pan half way.  Cover the pans and allow the dough to rise in the loaf pan for 30-45 minutes.  It will be complete when you see the bump coming through the covering cloth.  Step 5: Bake the Bread. Put the bread pans in the middle rack of a pre-heated oven set to 350 degrees F.

In this instructable, I will show you how to make Corn Tortillas with three ingredients and gluten free. A full instruction and downloadable recipe can be found on The Tortilla Channel.The tortilla is the base of the Mexican kitchen but also an egg dish in the Spanish kitchen. I have found that just about any culture has it\u2019s own tortilla. That is why you can\u2019t go wrong with a \u201ctortilla\u201d.I always used store bought tortillas thinking it would be either to difficult or take to much time to make them from scratch. Until I found how easy it is to make my own corn tortillas.  Ok they may not look the same as store bought ones or taste the same (they taste better in my opinion). The best part is you can use them as a base for other recipes think tacos or tortilla chips. Step 1: What Do You Need to Make This Recipe. <PIC> For corn tortillas you have to use special corn flour which is called Masa Harina. You should not confuse it with polenta flour or cornstarch. Masa Harina can be white or yellow. I bought the white variety but the yellow is even nicer with the happy color. As soon as you open the packet you smell taco making preparing even better. I found the flower online and it is also available in several varieties at Amazon.com.Besides the right flour it is also important to have a tortilla press or use a rolling pin. Put some plastic between the press and remove the dough as soon as you press else it can be more difficult to get them out. Either lay them apart or press just before you put the tortilla in a hot pan. Step 2: Instructions. <PIC> Put the 2 cups of Masa Harina in a bowl.  Add the salt to the bowl and stir thoroughly. Add 1 cup of hot water and stir again with a wooden spoon before adding the additional half cup of hot water.  Knead the dough into a consistent ball. Cover with a towel. Rest the dough for 1 hour. Create balls the size of a golf bal. Heat a large pan. Cover the tortilla press with plastic and press the tortilla. Cook the tortilla on medium to high heat for about 1 minute until the tortillas get some color. Turn and heat the other side of the tortilla for also 1 minute.  Store in a tortilla warmer or keep in a cloth. Step 3: Notes. <PIC> Make sure the water is hot to properly activate the Masa Harina.  I use a non stick pan to cook the tortillas without any oil or butter. You can store the torillas in a ziplock plastic bag in the refrigerator for about 1 week or in the freezer. You can heat them in a pan or in the microwave using a ziplock bag or cloth to cover them. Step 4: Watch the One Minute Video.

If your using a whole chicken breast it will need longer to cook the middle. Then after you have taken the chicken off the heat for a few minutes to cool, use a fork and knife to shred the chicken into small pieces. Step 3: Add Sauce and Spread on Naan. <PIC> Put the shredded chicken back in the skillet and add your curry sauce of choice. I simmered the mixture for about ten minutes to really cook the sauce into the chicken, but you could probably skip that and add the mix right onto the Naan because it will heat up in the oven. Then spread the curry sauce and chicken over two Naan flat breads, or you could make it work for 4 since I had leftover curry mix and used lots of chicken on my two.\u00a0 Step 4: Add Paneer and Bake. <PIC> Shred paneer cheese or crumble chunks over the pizzas, and put them in the oven at 450o\u00a0for about 8-10 minutes till the cheese melts.\u00a0 Step 5: Enjoy (*^.^). <PIC> I can't express in words how delicious this curry pizza was... but I'm also a huge fan of curry so try it out for yourself and tell me what you think!

Because that's how the Thai place down the street does it! \u00a0I don't think I've ever seen actual pumpkin in a pumpkin curry in all my days. \u00a0So I took that little tidbit and ran with it. Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> adapted from Thai Yellow Pumpkin and Seafood Curry by Nigella Lawson\n1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk (about 1 2/3 cups)\n1 to 2-tablespoons yellow Thai curry paste (or red if you like it hot!)\n1 1/2 cups chicken stock\n3 tablespoons fish sauce\u00a0\n2 tablespoons sugar\n1 lemongrass stalk, each cut into 1/3's and separated\n3 Thai basil leaves\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n3 cloves garlic, toasted\n2 1/4 pounds kabocha squash, peeled and cut into large, bite-sized chunks\n2 pounds chicken, diced (or substitute salmon and shrimp, or tofu)\nVegetables of your choice\n1/2 to 1 lime, juiced or more to taste\nMore Thai basil, for garnish\nYou can substitute cilantro for the basil if that's your thing. \u00a0More authentic that way! Step 2: How to Peel a Squash. <PIC> I was amazed at how little information there is on the internet to help me figure out how to handle peeling a squash like this. \u00a0 It's really hard to do it when the squash is still raw! \u00a0So this is what I did:\nWith a sharp knife, puncture some holes in the side of your squash.\nMicrowave on high for 6-8 minutes (mine needed 8).\nLet cool in the microwave for 2 minutes.\nUse a paring knife to peel away the skin of the squash. \u00a0 Much easier!\nYour squash is now partially cooked, meaning the rest of the dish will go even faster!\u00a0\nSeed and chop your squash into bite-sized pieces. Step 3: Procedure. <PIC> In a large saucepan or pot, stir together the coconut milk and curry paste until combined. \u00a0 Add the stock, fish sauce, sugar, lemongrass, Thai basil, and turmeric. \u00a0Bring to a boil.\nAdd the chicken (or other protein) and simmer for 4-6 minutes. \u00a0\nStir in pumpkin, garlic, and other vegetables. \u00a0Let simmer for another 4-6 minutes until everything is cooked through.\nSqueeze half a lime over the curry and stir to incorporate. \u00a0Adjust seasonings to taste!\u00a0 Step 4: Serve. <PIC> Serve over jasmine (my fave) or basmati rice. \u00a0\nGarnish with Thai basil, lime, and lemongrass stalks from the curry.\nThis recipe serves 4-6, and is great for leftovers. \u00a0I hope you give it a try!", "images_list": ["easy-pumpkin-curry-recipe_0", "easy-pumpkin-curry-recipe_1", "easy-pumpkin-curry-recipe_2", "easy-pumpkin-curry-recipe_3", "easy-pumpkin-curry-recipe_4"]}

(My first instructable!)WARNING: Contains alcohol, so please only make this if you are of legal age in your area.'PLEASE USE RESPONSIBLY AND LEGALLY!!! Step 1: Prepare Materials and Get Them Soakin'!. <PIC> This Instructable takes a bit more than a week to complete, but the end result is certainly worth it! You will need:- 1 1/2 cups of vodka (can use more or less if desired)- 1 tub of gummi bear candies, plastic with lid (about 1kg. Tub found at Wal-mart)- 1 can of frozen juice concentrate, any flavour desired (I used fruit punch.)You can keep the juice frozen for now, as you will not need it for a few days.- First step is to open the lid of your gummi bears and pour in the vodka. The amount and brand is at your discretion, though I have found 1.5 cups of Smirnoff vodka to be the best. I have tried this with raspberry vodka as well, with pleasurable results. Basically, pour the vodka into the packed bears until the alcohol barely peeks over the top. - Give your newly introduced gummi-bears and vodka a stir, and replace the lid. Place the whole tub into the fridge. - Let this sit for five days, stirring a couple of times each day.  Step 2: I've Created a Monster!.... I've Created 500 Monsters!. <PIC> After five days, much of your vodka will have been soaked into the bears and they may have gone through a significant growth spurt, as shown in the photo. Now is the time for the juice to be added.The purpose of the juice is to mask the strong vodka taste that exists in these candies. - Place a thawed can of frozen juice into a mixing container, and add only HALF of the required water. - Pour one cup of partially diluted juice into the tub of bears, stirring very well.- Replace the lid and place back in the refrigerator. Step 3: Wait for It..... <PIC> Let the bears sit in their juice and whatever vodka is left, for FOUR more days. This is essential because otherwise they will have a hard middle or will taste too much like vodka. Resist the urge to taste test! Stir twice a day to prevent sticking. Step 4: Finally, Our Lovely Mutants!. <PIC> Your gummi bears are finally finished! If there is a lot of excess juice/vodka resting in the bottom, you may drain it or leave it in to be further absorbed by the bears as they rest.Remember to return to the fridge if they are not all eaten -- which rarely happens!

{"id": "RECIPE_1917", "question": "What is the overall process for making these delicious popped amaranth and fruit tricolor crackers?", "provenance": [41209], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Popped Super Grain Amaranth and Fruit Tricolor Cracker. <PIC> Amaranth is a super grain because it  has 26g protein per cup (193g) (Wheat has 26g, rice has 5g), a complete protein profile, a good source of key vitamins, minerals such as calcium and iron, and a good source of fiber. Not only that, it is one of the alternative grains for wheat free or gluten free diet.   When I started an elimination diet of dairy, egg, fish and shell fish, peanut and tree nuts, soy, wheat, rice, corn, millet, and tapioca for my baby due to food protein allergies and intolerances, I found I was dying of lack of protein intake from the dozen regular foods that were eliminated for now. When I found out about amaranth's super food profile I immediately bought a bag of amaranth. Based on the information on the bag, boil amaranth in water, fluff with a fork, and I shall have something like rice to eat. What a lie! It looked and tasted like the sand in a river bed. I ate it anyway because nothing else to eat and prayed I wouldn't get stomachache or die. I ate it for three more days. Good news is my baby was fine with me eating it. That's when I started to do research and experiment with it.When I read somewhere amaranth can be popped like popcorn and eaten like cereal, I immediately dropped some in my popcorn air popper. Silly me! They all fell through the air holes at the bottom of the popper, I had to disassemble it to dump the grains out. Then I tried non stick pot to pop it. It worked but I didn't like the idea of dry heating non-stick pot and shaking it over the burner. Popping totally does the justice. I like the nutty flavor of popped amaranth. So I tried popping it with a stainless steel pot I have, it worked well. I'm happy heating and shaking the pot, soon became a pro amaranth popper, amaranth became the new wheat and rice for me, a hero and super food for me because of its protein amount, protein profile and other nutrition stats.Once amaranth popped, like it is said, it can be eaten as puff cereal; used as one of major granola components. Since I have been on the total elimination diet, I found it is impossible to find any snack in stores for me. So I developed this cracker that I can pop it in my mouth at any time and eat as finger food. It is crunchy like corn chips with sweet and tangy fruit flavor. If anyone in a party happens to be on as restrictive diet as I'm on and finds there is such tasty, healthy cracker to eat, they'll cry a river I think. On elimination diet or not, anybody can enjoy this cracker. To get popping and crunching, below are what were used:1 cup dry amaranth (makes about 4 and 1/2 cups popped amaranth) for 3 types of crackers1 stainless steel pot with long handle and see through glass lid100g dried apricot and 120g frozen peaches for yellow cracker (fresh peaches if in season)100g dried prune and 120g frozen peaches for dark cracker (fresh peaches if in season)100g dried apricot and 2 small to medium kiwi fruit for light greenish crackerBlenderBaking sheetKitchen rotary cutter or scissorsBelow are the 1-2-3 steps to make it. Step 1: Pop Amaranth. <PIC> A stainless steel pot with long handle and see through glass lid is a must.Heat the pot on medium to high heat for a few minutes.Drop only 1/4 tsp or so amaranth to test the temperature, if the grains pop immediately and become dark in color, the pot is too hot; if the grains takes long to pop or not pop but become dark in color, the pot is not hot enough, discard the burnt batch, adjust the heat and time you drop the second batch of the dry grains and it is the right hotness at any second. Once it's ready, you can keep popping without stopping. Please view my video for reference. Step 2: Prepare Fruit. <PIC> Use TIME DEFROST function to defrost frozen peaches on bursts of 3 minutes until defrosted.Chopped dried apricot and dried plum to small pieces.Peel and cut kiwi to chunks.Add each pair of fruits to your blend.Use Pulse and High Puree or whatever function that works to blend the fruits to thick puree. Add water 1 tbsp. at a time to get your blender going if it's too thick for it. I didn't need to add any water for the cracker using fresh kiwi.Empty the puree to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. to be sure, I used a lightly oily brush on the parchment paper.Spread the puree to a consistent thin layer on the baking sheet, the thinner the better, I used a soft tip spatula. It actually takes time to do this. I found doing it slowly is the quickest way to do it.Generously sprinkle popped amaranth over the fruit base, I used one cup per sheet. Pat over the top so they stay bound.  Step 3: Bake. <PIC> Bake at lowest oven temperature which is 170F on mine for 4 hours. Set timer at 3 hours to check on it.When you break off a small piece on the edge and it's crunchy, it's done. When it's cool, it will be crunchier. Peel away the parchment paper, let it cool.Break the whole sheet to small pieces or use kitchen rotary cutter or scissors to cut to small pieces. If you want the cracker to  be regular shapes and sizes, remove it from oven at 3 hour point when it's still hot and pliable, cut it to regular crackers, return it to oven to bake until they are crunchy.Store in airtight container if not consumed right away. Step 4: Serve. <PIC> Serve just it  or sprinkle light sea salt to add zest to the flavor.This Instructable will be entered in a couple of contests. Please vote for it If you like it.

If you have ever wanted to make  a funnel cake, fried Oreo, or fried Twinkie, this is the recipe for you .  Just one taste will take you right back to steamy summer nights at the fair.     Oh yeah and you will never have to shell out $5 a pop for your fix ever again.    Equipment needed Deep Fryer or Pan  Tongs and slotted spoon to fish out the fried goodness   Roll of paper towels.

Seriously that is it. there are no magic elves, no unobtanium just some simple mixing.  The above recipe so far has yielded 2 funnel cakes,  12 fried Oreo cookies, and 2 fried Twinkies.   I probably have enough left over to fry 2 more funnel cakes.   If put in a sealed container in the fridge I have stored it for 2 days after making.   But with the raw egg you wouldn't want to keep it much longer.  It does freeze however.... I use a deep fryer that automatically reaches temperature but if you are using a pan heat the oil to abut 375 degrees Fahrenheit.  Follow the directions on your fryer.  Now that your oil is heating up you have to decide what you want to fry up.    Step 1: Fried Oreo Cookies. <PIC> Using tongs or a fork dunk a cookie into the batter so that it is covered on all sides,  and gently place into the heated oil. Cook them for about 45-60 seconds on each side, turning them  them over once. The breading should be a golden brown color. After they are done frying place them on a plate covered in paper towels and dust them with powdered sugar to taste.  Step 2: \u200bFried Twinkies . <PIC> The first step is to freeze a Twinkie for a couple hours to ensure that the filling stays in the Twinkie while it is frying. Using tongs place a frozen Twinkie into the batter mixture and ensure that it is thoroughly coated before fryingAfter it has also fried for about 60 seconds rotate it so that the top side has a chance to cook . After they are done frying place them on a plate covered in paper towels and dust them with powdered sugar to taste. Step 3: \u200bFunnel Cakes. <PIC>  I don't use a funnel but I do pour the batter relatively slowly so that it forms the drizzle pattern we are so used to. Pour about 1/2 a cup of batter slowly into the hot oil in circular patterns. You will be able to see in the oil about how big the cake is going to be and spots that need more batter. After it has fried for about 60 seconds use your tongs to flip it and let it finish up on the other side. Then set on a plate covered with towels and dust with powdered sugar to taste.

{"id": "RECIPE_1929", "question": "What is the best way to create delicious Brazilian BBQ Churrasco Beef at home?", "provenance": [41216], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Brazilian BBQ Churrasco Beef. <PIC> Rio Grande do Sul is the birthplace of the churrasco, a barbecue tradition centered on beef at its best. There are plenty of churrascarias around where I live in the US, but doing it yourself and taking your churrasco outside is immensely gratifying. You only need a few simple things:Beef (I'll talk about picking out beef next)Food-grade ice cream salt or extra-coarse saltA really big skewerHardwood natural lump charcoalA BBQ, firepit, or other safe, legal place to burn said charcoal.A meat thermometer (optional, but so helpful!) Step 1: Select the Beef. <PIC> Thankfully, you don't need an expensive cut of meat for delicious churrasco. Look for some marbling of fat throughout the meat, and a nice layer of fat on one side. I also like to find cylindrical-shaped cuts, as these cook a bit quicker and more evenly than rounder cuts. You want about a half pound to a pound of meat per person. Step 2: Salt the Beef. <PIC> Ice cream salt is generally used for cooling down ice, allowing for old-fashioned ice cream making. I just learned that not all of it is actually labeled for consumption, though it's considered safe for food contact (such as chilling down a watermelon in salted water). Read all the fine print and seek out food-grade ice cream salt, or baring that, use the very coarse salt intended to refill salt grinder. Liberally press this all over the meat. These chunks will partially melt and do their magic when the meat cooks. It's essential! Use the chunkiest salt you can find! Step 3: Beef Meets Skewer. <PIC> You need a hefty skewer to hold up a huge chunk of beef -- something akin to a small sword (except without the sharp edges). My method for obtaining awesome skewers was marrying someone who had lived in Rio Grande del Sul. I've never seen skewers this big in any store in the United States, and I don't know how available they are elsewhere in the world outside of Brazil. There are internet suppliers of churrasco skewers, or you might be able to re-purpose a rotisserie skewer or other grilling equipment to this end. Step 4: Cooking the Beef. <PIC> Get some hardwood lump charcoal going. Avoid propane. Avoid chemically-bound briquettes. Really, the only flavors here are beef, salt, and smoke, so you want the smoke to be tasty, too.The thickness of your beef will determine how far away it needs to be from the coals. You don't want the outside to be burnt while the inside is still raw. Here, you can see the park BBQ just wasn't deep enough, so we improvised and used horizontal distance to keep the beef cooking slowly enough. In the past, in fire rings, we've also used bricks and rocks to prop up skewers a little higher. If the outside is turning golden in the first ten minutes, get the beef further away.Once you're set up, feel free to fiddle, turning the meat over regularly so it all cooks evenly. We cooked this two pound roast about eight inches away from the coals, for about forty-five minutes until medium-rare.You can try just prodding at the meat to feel for doneness, but I like to bring a probe thermometer and check two or three of the thickest places around the roast. I've found it's much more accurate, especially when I'm hungry. You can cut into the beef to check it, but this lets juices run out and toughens the meat.Rare is 125F, medium rare is 130F, and medium is 140F, and medium well is 150F. If you have a group with varying preferences, the ends are going to be somewhat more well-done than the center. Step 5: Rest and Eat. <PIC> Here it is -- all delicious and ready to go. If you are patient, you can wrap this in aluminum foil, cover with a towel, and allow the meat to rest for ten minutes. If you are not, slice and eat!Another traditional part of a churrasco is whole grilled pineapple -- pineapple supposedly helps you digest all that meaty goodness.

With Valentines Day less than a month away, I now have this bad boy in my arsenal and it will be new my go to for chocolate desserts. It is JUST so dang easy! I was a little nervous because I've never ever worked with Chia Seeds before. But now I am going to be hunting down a lot more recipes because this is BY far the easiest recipe I have ever used. I literally measured everything out, whisked it together, and then popped in the fridge over night! I could totally see a husband or a boyfriend making this for their girlfriend/wife, because honestly what woman doesn't LOVE chocolate! You will need:1 1/2 cups Almond Milk1/3 cup Chia Seeds3 tablespoons Coco Powder (the original recipe called for more, but this was all I had left and I feel like it was chocolate-y enough) Honey to taste (You can also use maple syrup or agave nectar)Strawberries (Optional Whipping Cream)**Note - I would say that this recipe would be suitable for two people** Let's get started!  Step 1: Measure and Whisk. <PIC> Measure out in a medium bowl or Tupperware container1 1/2 cups Almond Milk1/3 cups Chia Seeds3 Tablespoons Coco PowderWhisk, and keep whisking...Taste! At this point it was chocolate-y enough for me but still a little bitter so I added a squirt of honey. Everyones taste buds are different but I would recommend adding a little bit at a time!   Step 2: Cover and Refridgerate. Cover your chocolate-y goodness and let rest in the fridge overnight (or at least 5 hours) When you open the container it should have a pudding like consistency! **Note if the Chia Seed texture weirds you out you could blend the mixture until it smooth and creamy, but personally I liked the texture!** Step 3: Make the \"Parfait\". <PIC> Parfait in French actually means a frozen dessert made from a base of sugar syrup, egg, and cream but in my world it means to layer in a glass with berries or fruit and make look pretty! So rinse and chop your strawberries (you could use any other fruit that you think pairs well with chocolate!) Layering the strawberries first. Then scoop a dollop or two of the pudding. Another layer of berries. (A layer of whipping cream at this point is optional)Then maybe another dollop or two of the pudding! Garnish with a whole berry, chopped berries, or whipping cream. If I was making this for a party I would totally garnish with edible gold leaf (Found here)  Step 4: Enjoy! . <PIC> The image above is of my decadent goodness sitting on my windowsill in Germany as it snows outside! (What a great Saturday Treat!)Needless to say I ate it in about 5 minutes, and I can't wait to make this dessert again! Enjoy! (Here is the original recipe) Once you have the right ratio of Chia Seeds to Almond Milk you could really have fun exploring the different possibilities of flavors. I think I am going to try a \"Apple Pie\" rendition using vanilla, chopped apples and cinnamon! Yum! Xo!

That's what makes these cookies so fabulous, the fact that you can customize the flavor profiles to however you like!Enjoy eating! Step 1: Royal Ruby Shortbread Cookies. Begin with the cranberry - orange jam so it has a chance to thicken and cool down for the cookiesStart by adding cranberries, water, and sugar to a saucepan and stir so that all the sugar has been hydrated.Put on medium heat until the cranberries start to leech out water...Then carefully transfer mixture to a blender or food processor.Blend until the mixture is completely smooth, skins and all...Return mixture back to saucepan and continue to cook for 15 to 20 mins on medium heat...The jam should coat a wooden spoon without dripping comepletely off.Once the jam is done cooking add the zest of one orange, mix and then transfer into bowl and set in fridge.Then continue on to making the shortbread dough...Start by creaming sugar, salt, and butter in mixer or a bowl if using a hand mixer.Once creamy and smooth add vanilla and mix.Then add flour and mix on slow to prevent flour from going everywhere.Once the shortbread is done, wrap it up with plastic wrap and set in fridge for 45 mins to hour to get it cold and ready to roll out...Once ready to roll...Preheat oven to 350After the dough is chilled...Take dough out of fridge and flour counter surface that you are rolling the dough onto...Don't forget to flour the top of the dough and the rolling pin tooRoll dough out to about 1/4 in...You want to work a little fast because once the dough is warm, it is harder to work with and sticks to pin and counter... If the dough starts to become warm, no worries just transfer onto sheet tray and put back in fridge for 20 mins or so until dough is cold again...Once you have the dough rolled out take a biscuit cutter or round cookie cutter about 3 inches in diameter and cut out rounds out of dough...You can use scrap dough, just remember to smoosh all scrap pieces back together and put back in the fridge to get cold again...Once you have your rounds, pull out your jam and in the center of each round put about 2 teaspoons of jam...Once the jam is in place...Take a bowl and add one egg with a dash of water in it and mix with fork tto make egg wash...this is used as the glue to hold to triangle cookie shape...Brush egg wash with pastry brush circling around the jam on the dough on each round...Once egg was is on, pinch the sides of the round into threes to get that traditional triangle shape, should pinch 3 times on each round to make 3 corners to create the triangle...I like to cook these cookies on parchment paper, easy clean up... also the parchment helps prevent the bottom from over browning... And then you don't need to grease the sheet tray either!Set in oven at 350 for 12 to 15 mins ( until the corners are slightly golden browned) Once done take out and transfer onto a cooling rack...If you want to make these cookies even prettier, dust a little bit of powdered sugar on top for a more finished look!You can also make these cookies with raspberry, or strawberry... Just swap out the berries for the jam recipe.These cookies are so easy to make, and look extremely impressive. You can prep in advance by making jam and dough days before hand. You can alway make dough in advance ( even freeze dough) just remember if you plan on using frozen dough take it out of the freezer a day before making and set in fridge to thaw.Jam you can make up to a week in advance, just remember to put in air tight container to prevent any other flavors from the fridge seeping in...These cookies are such a delight, you will have all your family and friends asking for the recipe...

If you don't like kiwi, you may choose any other jelly with any flavor. For example, strawberry, pineapple, etc. The color of caviar will be also different. We take a syringe for 20 ml, sunflower oil, 300 ml of tap water, and any vessel. First, pour sunflower oil into a glass and put in freezer for about 30 minutes. Let's male jelly, while oil is freezing. One pack is rated at 400 ml of boiled water, but we are going to use just 300 ml to make caviar more flavored. Add the contents of the pack into the boiled water, and mix till dissolving. Let's move to the most interesting part, fill the syringe with jelly syrup, and drop it little by little into frozen oil.

Technically cheese/charcuterie plates/boards are appetizers, but my husband and I often enjoy them as a meal for lunch or dinner. One of my favorite things about this type of food is the variety, you can mix and match however you like. Creating your own charcuterie board can give you the feeling of being in France or Italy, without the airport lines and extra fees. A professional looking board can be whipped up in minutes and it doesn't have to break the bank. This Instructable focuses on creating a delicious meat platter.  Step 1: Meat. <PIC> Select an assortment of precooked/cured/preserved meats such as salami, prosciutto, sausages, pates, and spreads. I am not a fan of pre-sliced packaged prosciutto, so I get mine at the deli counter at Whole Foods--it is hands down one of the better prosciuttos I've tried.  Step 2: Cheeses. <PIC> Selecting cheeses for your board is pretty easy. It's recommended to have a soft, semi soft, firm and a hard cheese. Brie is a good soft cheese, as is mozzarella (not the shredded/fake stuff) or goat cheeses. Gouda and bleu cheese are good semi-soft. Hard cheeses are aged such as parmesan and asiago, or my favorite---Santori's Rum Runner.  Step 3: Accompaniments . <PIC> Spreads and jellies, fresh/dried fruits, vegetables, nuts, olives, crackers and bread all make great accompaniments to a platter. Step 4: Putting It All Together. <PIC> When planning for a group of people, about 5oz of food is a good rule of thumb. Place all of your meats and accompaniments on a nice tray and enjoy!

But we live in Asia, where it is hard to find these European style breads. Of course you can find them in hotel bakeries but they cost a fortune. So I bake my own.\u00a0 I bake with yeast or even with sour dough, sometimes easy recipes, sometimes quick ones.\u00a0This is a quick bread... well for a handmade bread this is quite quick.

I was inspired by this recipe for a Snickers ice cream cake: http://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/2013/05/28/snicker...The great thing about this recipe is that it doesn't involve trying to butcher a rectangular carton of ice cream into the shape of a circle. The ice cream in this recipe is simply a mixture of cream cheese, cool whip and a few other ingredients. It is thick enough to sit on top of the brownie layer without sinking in, but viscous enough to allow itself to be easily poured into a cake pan. Step 1: Get the Gang Together. <PIC> Ingredients:2 boxes brownie mix. (Top tip: If, like me, you only have cake mix to hand, you can still make brownies by simply adding 1 egg, 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup water, then bake at 350F for 20 mins.)60ml milk225g cream cheese55g brown sugar500g smooth peanut butter225g Cool Whip (or 240ml heavy whipping cream, 2 tbsp of powdered sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla)1 bottle chocolate syrup1 bottle caramel syrupMini pretzelsReese's Minis (220g bag)Equipment:8 inch springform panBaking parchmentCling filmHand or stand mixer Step 2: Bake Your Brownies!. <PIC> 1. Follow the instructions on the box to make two circular brownies. If, like mine, your brownies have sunk in the middle, then I'm afraid you're going to have to eat the taller section to ensure that you have a nice flat surface to work on. It has to be done.2. Once the brownies have cooled, wrap them in cling film and pop them in the freezer, ensuring they are kept flat. This will make everything easier and less fragile when you're assembling your cake.Keep the brownies in the freezer for at least 3 hours. Step 3: I Scream, You Scream. <PIC> Now that your brownies are good and frozen, its time to get cracking on the peanut butter ice cream.1. Add the milk, sugar, cream cheese and peanut butter to a large bowl, and mix until combined.2. Tip in your Cool Whip, and mix again until delicious soft, peanutty peaks form. At this point you may wish to taste your mixture. You never know, it could be poisoned, so you had better check.I'm glad it wasn't. If you still have any ice cream left, now its time for the assembly of your cake. Step 4: Assembly. <PIC> 1. Cut a circle of parchment paper with two \"handles\". These will make it easier to move the cake once it has been assembled and frozen solid. Place this in the base of your 8 inch springform pan which you used for your brownies. 2. My brownie layers were taller than the springform pan before the ice cream layers had even been added, so I extended the height of the pan with a strip of parchment paper, wedged in by the first brownie layer. (See pic 4)(The ice cream mixture is thick, so even the little support provided by the parchment is enough to keep the layers neat.)3. Once your first brownie is in the base of the pan, spread 120ml of chocolate syrup, and 120ml of caramel syrup over the brownie. 4. Add 1/3 of your available toppings. In this case, Reese's and pretzels.5. Split your ice cream mix in half and spread this on next.6. Now place your second brownie on top and apply gentle pressure.7. Spread on chocolate and caramel syrups again8. Add another third of your toppings9. Spread the rest of your ice cream on top10. Pop the cake in the freezer, parchment paper and all. Step 5: The Finishing Touches!. <PIC> Now I got a bit excited and took my cake out before it was ready, so mine was a bit melty.. Don't do that. Wait at least 4 hours, and then you can begin removing your cake from the tin.After peeling off the parchment around the side, the handles can be used to lift your cake out of the tin base and onto a plate. Next, pinch a handle and slide it out from underneath the cake. As it is sitting against the dry brownie layer it should slide out quite easily.Decorate the top of your cake with the remaining toppings, and then drizzle the top with as much syrup as you desire.Serve immediately, or hide it at the back of the freezer if you want to keep it for yourself.", "images_list": ["peanut-butter-pretzel-ice-cream-cake_0", "peanut-butter-pretzel-ice-cream-cake_1", "peanut-butter-pretzel-ice-cream-cake_2", "peanut-butter-pretzel-ice-cream-cake_3", "peanut-butter-pretzel-ice-cream-cake_4", "peanut-butter-pretzel-ice-cream-cake_5"]}

Each step needs proper techniques and practice  to do it successfully.For this you will need:Espresso MachineEspresso CupsCoffee BeansCoffee GrinderThermometer MilkChocolate Sauce TamperCold Milk Frothing Pitcher Glass CupHere's the finished product Step 1: Grinding, Tamping, Pouring.. <PIC> Grinding:Ideally you would grind your coffee with a bur grinder, but those can be very expensive, and most people don't have access to one so I will teach you how to use a blade grinder.Coffee is freshest immediately after it is ground.  After grinding coffee beans, the oils that were protected inside the bean are exposed to the air which oxidizes and stales the coffee.  This occurs immediately after coffee grinding so it is important to tamp and extract the espresso as quickly as possible.  The coffee grinder should be ran for 15-20 seconds every time a shot is desired so that only freshly ground coffee is used, for this reason it is not recommended to use pre-ground.Tamping:When your tamping the goal is to make a pellet of coffee that the the hot water from the espresso machine will penetrate evenly.  Since the water from the espresso machine is under pressure, the espresso pellet must be hard and evenly tamped. Once your done grinding, put the ground coffee into you filter,  use 2.5 to 3 teaspoons for a double shot. Put the filled coffee filter on a sturdy surface, and take your coffee tamper and place it on top of the coffee in the filter. It should fit snugly into the top of the filter. If the tamper is too small, the coffee around the edges of the filter won_x0019_t be compressed, and the water will flow through the grounds there, losing its flavor. Press straight down, applying even, firm pressure. You should aim for about 30 pounds of pressure. Push down, twisting slightly in one direction and lift straight up. The surface of the coffee should be smooth with no crumbs. Brush away any crumbs of coffee from around the edge of the filter and place the filter onto your espresso machine.Pouring:As a general _x0018_rule of thumb_x0019_, the darker the roast the shorter the extraction time should be. For example, espresso uses a Dark roast, and therefore the extraction time is quite short. The ideal rate-of-pour for espresso has the consistency of syrup, About  25-30 seconds.To preserve the flavor of your coffee beans, you must protect them from moisture, light, and above all, air Step 2: Foaming. <PIC> When foaming your milk, use very cold milk.  It is important to keep the milk temperature right above freezing.  Keep the steam pitchers in the refrigerator also.  This will allow you to steam the milk for a longer period of time. Fill your milk pitcher half way with cold milk and place the tip of the frothing wand  about 1/4 inch_x001D_- 1/2 inch_x001D_  below the milk surface level. Then slightly tilt the pitcher (if the bottom of the pitcher is parallel with the floor, tilt  the pitcher about 15 degrees).  Make sure to tilt the front of the pitcher towards the frothing device. Then release the valve to full blast. You will will hear a high pitched squeal, as this happens you will notice the level of the milk will rise. If you see large bubbles starting to grow on the top of the milk, your wand is too close to the top, and if you see no foam form on the milks surface, and hear a deep, throaty wine, the wand is down too deep.Keep doing this until a foam dome is formed at the very top of the pitcher. Once the temperature reaches 180 degrees, stop heating the milk.This can take a lot of practice to get it just right, so I recommend using an electric milk frother until you master it. Step 3: Making the Layers. <PIC> Once you have your espresso shots, and frothed milk, take out your glass cup and chocolate syrup.The first thing you pour in is your milk, on the bottom will be your milk, and on top will be the foam.Then pour in your espresso shots right down the middle, you will notice it stays in the middle.Then take out your chocolate syrup and pour it in until you can see it at the button, and then put a thin layer of chocolate on top of the foam. (make sure not to make it too thick or it will sink.)And you have your finished product, a 5 layer macchiato.This is a great example of density.  Looking at this drink we can see that Chocolate Sauce is very dense, and the foam is not.Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given unit volume (density = mass/volume). Put simply, if mass is a measure of how much \u2018stuff\u2019 there is in an object, density is a measure of how tightly that \u2018stuff\u2019 is packed together.", "images_list": ["how-to-make-a-macchiato_0", "how-to-make-a-macchiato_1", "how-to-make-a-macchiato_2", "how-to-make-a-macchiato_3"]}

{"id": "RECIPE_2023", "question": "What are the essential steps to whip up a delicious batch of O'Henry Bars without spending too much time in the kitchen?", "provenance": [41277], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Quick & Easy Cookie Alternative. <PIC> Follow these instructions to make a quick, chocolatey-peanut butter dessert called O'Henry Bars (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/O-Henry-Bars/Detail.aspx). \u00a0This sweet delight can easily appetize several dozen guests or just a few seriously chocolate-craved individuals!\nYou will not need a lot of previous baking experience or several hours of spare time.\nYou will need:\n4 cups rolled oats\n1 cup packed brown sugar\n1 cup OR 3/4 cup butter\n1/2 cup light corn syrup\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)\n1 cup semisweet chocolate chips\n3/4 cup peanut butter\nYou'll also need access to a conventional oven for baking the oatmeal base and something like a stove-top range for melting the chocolate topping.Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius). Step 1: Mix Dry Ingredients. <PIC> Grab a large mixing bowl, and prepare to measure out the dry ingredients:4 cups of rolled oats\n1 cup of packed brown sugar\nPile the oats into a clean mixing bowl with a measuring. \u00a0Unlike with flour, your measurements need not be super accurate.\nPack 1 cup of brown sugar into the same measuring cup, and drop the sugar into the mixing bowl with the oats. \u00a0If you've never packed brown sugar before, it's pretty simple. \u00a0Pour or scoop some sugar into the measuring cup, and then press it down with your fingers until it feels firm. \u00a0Keep adding and pressing sugar until you get a 1 full cup of packed brown sugar leveled flat.\nNow that you have a mini sugar castle in the mixing bowl, break up the brown sugar, and begin stirring it in with the oats. \u00a0I find it helpful to start by pushing up the stuff on the bottom. \u00a0Keep stirring until only a few clumps of brown sugar remain. Step 2: Mix-in Liquid Ingredients. <PIC> Gather together the liquid ingredients:3/4 or 1 cup of softened butter - choose 1 cup if you want a gooey base1/2 cup of light corn syrup1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, if desired - for extra flavor\nTo quickly soften butter straight from the fridge, unwrap the sticks (1-1/2 for 3/4 cup or 2 for 1 cup) into a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on high for about 15 seconds. \u00a0After this, the butter should be easy to deform with your fingers but firm enough to hold its own shape. \u00a0Alternatively, you can leave the sticks unrefrigerated for 20 to 30 minutes, but you do not want them to melt completely.\nAdd the softened butter to the bowl, and mix thoroughly. \u00a0It may take a few minutes of stirring, and even some \"chopping\" action with the mixing spoon, to get it completely mixed in with the dry ingredients. \u00a0If your guests won't mind, dive in with your fingers to make the process go faster.\nMeasure out and pour in the corn syrup and vanilla. \u00a0After you stir\u00a0the oatmeal mixture one more time, it will be ready for the oven! Step 3: Bake Until Golden. <PIC> If you haven't already, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).Read carefully! \u00a0Baking is the easiest part of this recipe to mess up because the oatmeal mix does not look much different when it is done in the oven. \u00a0Trust me, you don't want to burn these babies!\nA 9 by 13 inch pan is perfect for this recipe, but O'Henry bars are quite adaptable to whatever you want or need. \u00a0Feel free to use different pan sizes and types to get a dessert perfect for your occasion. \u00a0Want a bar that's extra thick and hearty? No problem; just watch the oven carefully.Generously grease all of the bakeware that you will be using with cooking spray. \u00a0There's no need to drench the pan, but using too little will make it challenging to get the bars completely out!\nEvenly press the oatmeal mix into a greased pan. \u00a0Traditionally, the base should be about 3/4 inch high. \u00a0Place the pan on the center rack of a conventional oven (remember hand protection).Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the oatmeal just starts to turn golden brown. \u00a0Take the pan out of the oven, and set it out to cool. \u00a0While hot, the mix will remain as pliable as before. \u00a0Don't worry; it will become firm as soon as it cools.\nThe bars are already delicious enough to eat, but the best is yet to come! Step 4: Prepare Topping. <PIC> Making the chocolate-peanut butter topping is fast and fun!\nFind a small pot or saucepan and get the following ingredients:1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips\n3/4 cup peanut butter\nIn the cool pot, measure and add the chocolate chips and peanut butter. \u00a0Trying to measure and transfer the peanut butter may require a little patience but shouldn't be too much trouble with a simple butter knife.\nSet the pan on a burner set to low heat. \u00a0When I used natural gas burners, the chocolate began melting immediately. \u00a0Stir continuously to keep any of the chocolate from scorching. \u00a0The natural oils of the the peanut butter help prevent burning. \u00a0Very quickly, the chocolate chips melt and fuse with the peanut butter to make a\u00a0chocolaty\u00a0tonic worthy of Charlie's chocolate factory!\nOnce the chocolate and peanut butter are completely mixed together, pour the topping immediately onto the cooling oatmeal base. \u00a0If you are sticking with time-tested tradition, gently spread the chocolate evenly with the flat of a large spoon. \u00a0I find it best to not be a perfectionist in this step because too much fussing with the spreading can cause the oatmeal to pull up and crumble, which does not look attractive.\nEven more so than with the oatmeal base, you can be as creative or picky as you like with the topping! \u00a0Pile it thicker an' deeper or elegantly drizzle it across. \u00a0You may also wish to try different ratios of peanut butter and chocolate. \u00a0If you run out of topping, it's a snap to whip up some more. Step 5: Refrigerate and Serve. <PIC> The O'Henry Bars are nearly ready to be devoured, but they are best served chilled. \u00a0Refrigerate them for at least an hour, or, in a pinch, put them in a freezer for a fraction of the time.\nAllow them to warm up for a little bit before cutting into them. \u00a0Slice them\u00a0into pieces\u00a0(a normal butter knife will do) into whatever serving size you wish. \u00a0Be sure to cut the pieces well, so that they will\u00a0effortlessly\u00a0pull away from the pan.Serve and enjoy!!\nO'Henry Bars travel well in tupperware\u00a0containers. \u00a0Keep them covered to prevent dryness.", "images_list": ["quick-easy-cookie-alternative_0", "quick-easy-cookie-alternative_1", "quick-easy-cookie-alternative_2", "quick-easy-cookie-alternative_3", "quick-easy-cookie-alternative_4", "quick-easy-cookie-alternative_5"]}

{"id": "RECIPE_2025", "question": "What is the best way to prepare a delicious oven-baked chicken and rice dish?", "provenance": [41278], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Oven Baked Chicken and Rice. <PIC> Today I'd like to share with you how I made an oven baked rice and chicken drumstick casserole! I'm away at university most of the time where my normal meals consist of breakfast cereal, the $10 pick up special from Pizza Nova or... well, mostly just those too.For some reason I felt like mixing it up this weekend and this is the result. It's a basic recipe yes, but most of the time to make it is just the thing in the oven cooking (10 minutes prep). This is great because that means I can go back to browsing Instructab- I mean... doing homework during that time. This was my first time making this dish. I looked up a few online recipes and Youtube videos about oven baking rice and chicken, put them together and ended up with the recipe outlined in this article. It turned out quite well in my opinion. Thoughts on the process and any improvements I feel I could have made are outlined on the last step.Hope you enjoy! PS: This is my entry into the Beyond the Comfort Zone, and Slow Cooking contests. I'm not sure if this really counts as slow cooking, but considering my microwave pasta trays only take 4 minutes to cook, an hour and a half seems like a pretty long time to me.I would really appreciate your votes if you believe this instructable to be worthy of them! Step 1: Ingredients and Utensils. <PIC> Ingredients:5 chicken legs (drumsticks)1 Can Cream of Mushroom or Celery Soup1 cup water3/4 packet of onion soup mix (dry)1 1/4 cup of white rice (not instant)Olive Oil (for greasing the dish, can substitute for butter or cooking spray)Utensils:Oven-safe casserole dish (mine was 2.3L, with a glass cover)Mixing BowlWhiskMeasuring CupsMeat Thermometer (technically optional but highly recommended)Oven (not optional)In the photo you see I also have a bag of Vegeta shown. I was originally going to try and add that in somewhere but did not. I'm leaving that for an experiment for the next batch, in which I would probably substitute part of the onion soup mix for the Vegeta. If it works, I'll update this recipe. Step 2: Preparing the Dish. <PIC> Preheat your oven to 350oF before you begin, and it should be ready by the time you are. Grease the casserole dish using olive oil, melted butter or cooking spray. Measure out the rice and distribute it evenly over the bottom of the dish.Combine the canned soup, water, and onion soup powder in a mixing bowl, and whisk until well mixed. Try to make sure that there are no clumps from the canned soup remaining.Pour the mix evenly over the rice. Lightly mix together with the rice.Wash your hands before touching raw poultry. Take the chicken legs and place them side by side in the rice. Roll them around so they are covered in the rice/soup mix. Wash your hands again after you have finished handling the meat.Place the cover on your casserole dish and place it in the preheated oven, for 1.5 hours. Step 3: After Cooking. <PIC> After an hour and a half has passed, carefully remove the dish from the oven with oven mitts or a towel. The rice should have expanded. Use an instant read thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature of the chicken is 165oF or higher. Thermometers take the guesswork out of ensuring your meat is fully cooked. My midterms are in two weeks, I'd really rather not get Salmonella :)Let stand for 5 minutes with the cover still on. Step 4: Enjoy!. <PIC> Your oven baked chicken and rice is ready to eat! With a casserole dish sized similar to mine you can probably get 4 or 5 servings out of one batch. Improvements to the RecipeI've already updated this recipe with what I believe would make this recipe better. When I first made it, the taste of the rice was slightly too intense, so adding a little bit more water and a little bit less onion mix would fix that.Like I mentioned on the ingredients page, I plan to swap the onion soup powder for Vegeta in later experiments, because I believe my grandmother uses it when she makes chicken and rice like this. And I love my grandmother's rice.I didn't think of it at the time, but next time I'd probably prepare some broccoli or other vegetable to go with this to make it a full meal.Thanks for reading!I'd be interested to know your thoughts on this recipe - perhaps someone more skilled can offer some advice on how to further improve it!

Mo bacon! These meatballs are infused with bacon to make them special.Prepared with a pan cream sauce that makes it all the more delectable.CAUTION: Do not attempt eating mass quantities of Swedish meatballs. They are filling and addictive. I think my record at IKEA stands at about 25. It might be the Ligonberry preserves or that dollop of mashed potatoes that puts it over the top. Step 1: The Secret Ingredient Is.... <PIC> BACON.For the meatballs, you will needone pound of ground beefequal portion of ground porkabout one cup of dry or toasted bread crumbsone eggsome milk or cream to wet the breadcrumbsdiced onionsbeef stock if you have itsalt, pepper, and any other spices/seasonings you likea few tablespoons of flour to thicken up the gravy Step 2: A Watched Pot Never Boils.... <PIC> Dice up about a quarter to half pound of bacon.In a large pan, render out the fat from the bacon over medium heat. I like to add some additional cooking oil to help the process and to prevent bacon bits from burning and sticking in the pan.Finely dice up two large onions.Once the bacon starts to brown and the fat has rendered out of the bacon strips, add the onions to brown.It may take a while for the onions to release its moisture and start to caramelize or brown.Keep stirring to keep things from burning.When everything is nice and browned, take it off the heat to cool. You will end up with a smaller volume of soft baconey caramelized onioney goodness.You can pick out the larger pieces of remaining bacon and finely chop that up. Step 3: Balls.... <PIC> In a big bowl,add the two ground meats togetherAdd a cracked eggAdd your breadcrumbsAdd the cooled chopped/crumbled bacon onion mix inWet the breadcrumbs with a bit of milk or creamAdd any additional seasoningsMix well and shape into small ping pong ball sized shapesYou can dump out the entire mix on a cutting board. Flatten out and portion out by cutting with a knife like slicing a sheet cake. You can then just roll the pieces by hand to get into a ball shape.Brown the meatballs in the frying pan with more oil or additional bacon.Wait till they are browned a bit and set up before attempting to turn them. They are still fragile at that point.Roll them around often so that they do not burn. It might take a while so that they are completely cooked through.One batch was pan fried. The rest I put on a the toaster oven tray to bake off in the toaster oven. That is a more efficient way to cook a large batch and without the spatter. Step 4: Getting Sauced.... <PIC> Remove the meatballs from the pan.You should be left with some bacon drippings and meatball flavor goodness stuck to the bottom of the pan.Throw in a couple of tablespoons of flour to mix into the grease left in the pan.Stir it around and let it cook. This is making the roux to thicken the gravy.When the flour gets browned it is time to add in a cup or two of milk or cream. Add in any beef stock if you have it.Continually stir to mix and to scrape up the flavor from the stuck bits in the pan.Since we are real cooks and don't measure, the gravy might be thickening up to the point of where it is a thick paste. If you can stick your stirring instrument into it and stand it up, you used way too much flour.Don't worry, add more milk or cream and keep stirring. Dissolve all the lumps out. Lower the heat a bit so it doesn't boil over like a mad science experiment.Give it a taste and adjust the seasoning. It will probably first taste like a bland glue until you add salt.You can then return the meatballs into the sauce to warm up or serve it on the side.Enjoy.", "images_list": ["mo-betta-swedish-meatballs-and-cream-sauce_0", "mo-betta-swedish-meatballs-and-cream-sauce_1", "mo-betta-swedish-meatballs-and-cream-sauce_2", "mo-betta-swedish-meatballs-and-cream-sauce_3", "mo-betta-swedish-meatballs-and-cream-sauce_4"]}

Look no further than \"Dino Ribs.\"  Essentially they are a set of beef ribs, cooked low and slow, complete with their own handles. While it might take a little advance planning to source the ribs, the actually preparation and grilling process couldn't be simpler.IngredientsA beef plate consisting of the largest four ribs*   Salt and pepper to taste   Your Favorite Rub (we used Sassy Steak Rub from AmberFyre Foods)ToolsAluminum Foil   A sharp knife (essential, we use this boning knife)   A steam table pan if using a smoker   Grill or Smoker*A whole beef plate is not something your average chain grocery store will carry, so it pays to enlist the help of your local specialty butcher. If they don't offer \"dino ribs\" or \"bronto ribs\" simply call ahead and ask for the largest four ribs of a beef plate, connected and untrimmed. Be prepared to call two or three days in advance, since this part of the cow is normally divided up for other cuts. A photo is included to help communicate to the butcher what you are looking for. Step 1: Trim the Ribs. <PIC> Preheat your grill or smoker to around 225-250 degrees Fahrenheit. If smoking with wood chips, be sure to have soaked them in advance. You may need to separate the ribs into two pieces to fit them into your smokebox, as we did. If you are smoking on top of your grill, you can omit this step.In order to prepare the ribs, trim off as much excess fat as you can, leaving between 1/2 and 1/4-inch on the ribs. Also trim the tough material on top of the rib bones on the back side, called a silverskin, it makes separating the ribs and enjoying them more difficult after they are cooked. Step 2: Season, Season, Season. <PIC> Salt and Pepper the ribs as you would a steak, then apply your favorite steak rub...liberally. It may look like a lot, but after several hours in a smoker or on a grill, the rendering of fat as well as the shear mass of this hunk of meat, is going to need every bit of that seasoning.Wrap the ribs in foil and you are now ready to put them in the smoker or on the grill. Step 3: Smoke 'em If You Got Em!. <PIC> Smoke the ribs for about 6-8 hours, turning them every 2 hours when you normally check your wood chips. If you are using a box smoker like in the picture, be sure to place a steam table pan in between the heat source and the ribs. There is a lot of fat on this type of cut that will render out when cooking, and the risk of fire becomes great. In the picture above, the ribs on top and the brisket underneath produced about two quarts of liquid fat.  Not the sort of thing you want igniting before your cookout.When the ribs are done, slice them into individual portions and serve. Step 4: Enjoy Dino Ribs!. <PIC> As you can see from the picture above, the meat on the dino ribs contracts as it cooks, creating it's own carrying handle. We like to serve them with sliced brisket and a little cherry bourbon bbq sauce for dipping.

This recipe is for three basic types which can be made at home. All you need is a griddle or large frying pan and a rolling pin. The dough is very simple and requires only wholewheat (or spelt) flour, water and a bit of olive oil.A roti is a very simple round flatbread and is the easiest to make. Then there is the square one (prautha) which is made into a square shape by first rolling a circle, applying butter and spices and then folding it over 4 times to make a square before rolling it out one more time. The third one is a stuffed prautha (aloo prautha) which is very popular in Punjab. It is made by rolling out two smaller rotis and adding a filling in between them. The same dough is used to make all of them. Yield: 6 flatbreads   Servings: 3 - 4   Prep Time: 15 minutes   Cook Time: 10 minutes   Ready In: 25 minutes Ingredients 2.5 to 3 cups whole wheat or spelt      flour  Water  Olive oil Step 1: Make Dough. <PIC> Make dough in a medium bowl by adding some water and a drizzle of olive oil to the flour, and mixing it with your hands. Keep adding water in small amounts and mixing with your hands until it all comes together. Add more water as needed to be able to knead the dough until it has a smooth pliable texture (3 to 4 minutes). Set aside to allow the dough to breath and soften for 15 minutes. It can also be made ahead and set aside until you are ready to cook.  Step 2: \u200bPreheat Griddle. <PIC> Preheat griddle or flat pan on medium high heat. Put about a cup of dry flour into a large plate or pie plate. Roll your fingers in this dry flour to avoid dough from sticking to hands. Take some dough and form into a small 2 inch ball with both hands. Roll it in the dry flour and flatten into a disk. Add some more dry flour on both sides and roll out into a 6 to 7 inch circle by rolling and turning over once or twice to get a nice circular shape.  Step 3: Cook for About One Minute. <PIC> Place on preheated griddle. Cook for about one minute before flipping it over with a spatula. Cook the other side for about two minutes to allow it to blister a little. Then flip over again to have the blistered side on top. Apply gentle pressure with the spatula to encourage roti to rise. (The steam trapped inside the roti will help it to rise). Remove from stove and place on a plate lined with aluminum foil. Apply butter or oil to keep it soft.

Braised in beer, slow cooked to perfection,and glazed with hoisin and honey, these will undoubtedly be your go to meal choice when you are looking for a special night with your lady (or man). The Asian style pickles provide a nice touch of acid that helps to cut the richness of the meat. Feel free to use but be careful, one bite and that special someone will never want to leave, so make sure they're the one! :-) Step 1: Rub Your Meat. <PIC> When making the rub, set your ribs out and allow to come to room temp. Combine 4 tbsp salt, 3 tbsp onion and garlic powders, 2 tbsp black pepper, 3 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tbsp paprika, 2 tbsp chili powder, and 2 tbsp Chinese 5 spice in a large mixing bowl. Stir tocombine and press the short ribs in the spice rub, covering all sides with a good thick later of rub. This spice quantity gives you just enough for 6 ribs. Step 2: Get Your Braise On/ Jacuzzi Anyone?. <PIC> Choose a good beer, I went with New Belgium fat tire. You'll need just under 2 bottles, so feel free to take a couple sips. Chop 1 onion and 4 cloves of garlic. Heat a Dutch oven over medium high heat until almost smoking. Add 2 tbsp olive oil and add meat. Brown on all sides, searing in all flavor. Once browned remove from pan and add onions and garlic. Saut\u00e9e 2 minutes. Stir to remove browned bits from bottom of the pan and add beer, 32 oz chicken broth, and remaining spice rub to Dutch oven. Return meat to pan and ensure liquid covers meat. Bring to boil, cover and reduce heat to simmer. Simmer for 2.5 hours. Step 3: Pick a Pickled Pepper. <PIC> While meat is brazing, thinly slice your favorite vegetables, a mandolin or very sharp knife are needed. Any will do, but get the freshest you can find, trust me you won't regret it. I used daikon radish, red radish, red bell pepper, seedless cucumber, garlic, onion, and bean sprouts all from the local farmers market. Combine 1 c rice wine vinegar, 1 c water, 3 tbsp sugar, 1tsp salt in a sauce pan and bring to boil. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Pour over veggies and place in fridge approx 2 hours or until meat is done. Step 4: Seal the Deal. <PIC> Remove the short ribs from the braising liquid and place on a cookie sheet. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Mix 1/4 c hoisin with 3tbsp honey and spread on ribs. Place in oven for 10 mins. This gives the ribs a seal to hold all of that flavor in and really takes this dish over the top. Step 5: Plating. <PIC> Remove the ribs from the oven straight to the plate you are serving on. You can add mashed potatoes or whatever starch you would like. I prefer whipped sweet potatoes for their color and taste on this dish. Give a good handful of pickled veg served beside the meat and go to town. Your date will immediately know this dish was made and served with love and will keep them coming back from more.

{"id": "RECIPE_2053", "question": "What is the overall process for crafting a delicious mead from honey and water?", "provenance": [41302], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Mead Making. <PIC> Mead!\nAn ancient beverage created through the fermentation of\u00a0honey\u00a0and water.\nThis simple Instructable is meant to help guide the beginner mead maker and is not intended to be a full discussion of the biochemistry, though I may provide a more thorough run down in a future piece.\u00a0Mead has a lot of variants, so in order to keep things fairly simple, I've chosen to start off with a Metheglin, which is a mead that contains some herbs and spices. If you want to make a traditional sack mead or quick mead, omit the herbs and spices.\u00a0\nThe ingredients in the Image 1 are all you'll need to make a fine mead. Equipment is not pictured here are: purified water, a sampling cylinder, pH strips, hydrometer, a clean mesh splatter guard, funnels, boiling vessels, bung locks, tubing, airlock, primary and secondary fermenters. You should also get yourself a Vinebrite filter.\u00a0Starting Out:\u00a0\n1. Clean all your equipment thoroughly. This will require more than simply running it through the dishwasher. I recommend acquiring some OneStep or Starsan\u00a0to make sure you've really done a good job sterilizing your equipment. (The old microbiology adage is that there is no such thing as a little sterile. Since you are not working in a Class 100 bioproduction suite, the cleaner you can be, the better.)\u00a0\n2. Ensure you have sufficient starting materials. Write out your recipe in your notebook. Nothing is more frustrating than having to run back out to the store when you're knee deep in this recipe.\u00a0\n3. Safety. A good apron and a set of kitchen mitts and gloves are vital to this recipe. Hot honey is not fun to spill on yourself or others.\u00a0Ingredients:\u00a0\nEverything is ratios for this kind of work, which is nice because you can scale you recipe up and down more easily if you base everything on volume of the batch.\nYou will want to end up with a specific gravity of 1.09 (Image 2) to start the primary fermentation if you want your mead to have a punch to it. This works out to about 2.5-3 lbs of honey per gallon (1.1-1.4 kg/3.8 L). Make it a little heavier if you want sweeter and alcoholic meads, and a little lighter if you like it to be a bit more balanced.\u00a0\nYou want to have a good amount of acid starting out in the primary fermenter. You'll accomplish this by juicing a few oranges and a couple lemons into the water when you set the honey on to heat. To improve the flavor of the mead and it's mouth feel, you can zest the lemon and the oranges into the batch. Check the pH on your final must to make sure you are in the pH 3.5-4 range (Image 3). If you need to go lower, add a bit of acid blend or lemon juice.\u00a0\nFor the chemical additives, I recommend following the directions on the the yeast nutrient and the grape tannin to ensure you've used enough of them.\u00a0Boil\nAn important note on honey is that you don't have to boil it to sterilize it. Wild yeast can be killed in 22 minutes at 147 F (64F). The more important need to boil the honey is to facilitate the removal of the dissolved wax inherent in most commercially available honey. If you don't remove this wax the yeast may have a difficult time maintaining itself in solution and will agglutinate and fall to the bottom of the fermenter. While the honey water mixture is heating, it will begin to form a foam on the top of the solution. Use the clean splatter guard to remove this foam (Image 4). Once the foam is removed, you can add your cloves, vanilla bean, cardamon, and cinnamon to the batch.\u00a0Pour\nUse the funnel to pour the hot (Not boiling) mixture into your clean fermenter. Once the material cools to ~ 65-75F (18-24C) it can be innoculated with the yeast. Take a sample of the primary fermenter, put in your yeast (number of packets depends on your total volume). Allow 15-60 minutes for this sample to begin fermenting. Innoculate the fermenter with the yeast mixture and stir the vessel. Once innoculated, the fermentation will be vigorous for the first 6-12 days. You will want to have a closure that allows for a lot of gas to escape, but prevents things like insects (Fruit-flies!) to gain access to the mixture. (Image 5 contains a blow off tube system. A tube is attached to a valved spigot which runs from the top of the fermenter to a jug full of water. The tube is placed down into the water. This allows gas to escape but nothing can enter the fermenter.) Be sure to leave some headspace in your fermenter or you will probably get some overflow as you volume will increase a bit as the yeast begin to release carbon dioxide.\u00a0Secondary and Tertiary Fermentation:\u00a0\nAfter the inital fermentation, the amount of bubbling should have lessened or even subsided. It's time to \"rack\" the fermetation into an airlocked vessel (Preferably glass, steel, lexan, or PETG). The primary simply needs to be put through a large strainer and into the secondary (Image 6). (You can add some vitamin C, ascorbic acid, to this to reduce the impacts of oxidation. Further you can use a liquid handling\u00a0peristaltic\u00a0pump or a siphon and run the solution down the side of the secondary fermenter.) Whatever your method, it is vitally important to be very clean during the racking. Once the solution is transferred, you can put your air lock onto the secondary and put the mead in a dark place where the temperature is stable. In 1-2 months, you should check your mead and rack it again (off the lees, which are the precipitated yeast and waste materials of the fermentation.) Each successive racking should go through finer and finer filter materials until it can pass through a vinebrite filter. Once it can go through this filter you are ready for bottling.\nYou'll know your mead is ready as it will be crystal clear, the amount of bubbles in the solution will be minimal and it will have a strong alcohol content. This will be\u00a0evidenced\u00a0by \"legs\" in your wine glass and by taking a sample of the batch and comparing the hydrometer reading to the original reading. The fermenter solution should read 1.00 at the end of fermentation.\u00a0Kegging/Bottling\nMead can be stored in barrels like a wine or a whiskey, it can also be bottled and corked in Wine Bottles. (You can even wax the tops of the bottles if you like, Image 7).\u00a0Mead ages very well as long as it is kept out of the light and in a cool dry place. The average amount of time that I age my mead for is between 3-6 months. I always kick myself for not aging it to the longer end of that range (Image 8).\u00a0Good luck and enjoy mead making!\u00a0", "images_list": ["mead-making_0"]}

This indestructible is all about food and physics. It will guide you through a Food Network flourless chocolate torte recipe while applying physics to it. You will learn\u00a0and\u00a0eat delicious chocolate goodness! :)\u00a0 Step 1: Background of Thermodynamics and Baking. Before you start, here is some background to thermodynamics and baking: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When baking with thermodynamics it\u2019s all about convection heating. Oven coils heat and then a fan blows, circulating cool and warm air. The collected heat stays safe in the oven as the infrared waves bounce around. As the outside of the torte heats first but then as the heat grows inside, there is a buildup of pressure and the temperature within and the torte will rise slightly. At this point, the outside layers of the torte have already cooked and hardened, cracking a bit. This means that there is no room for expansion and the inner layers of the torte will be forced to heat up; this will cause the inside of the torte to cook. Also, this is all a chemical reaction and Conservation of Energy must be remembered. Energy is not created or destroyed. It is simply transferred and moved around. Link to the recipe used:\u00a0http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/flourless-chocolate-torte-recipe/index.html\u00a0 Step 2: Ingredients. <PIC> You'll need (Recipe from FoodNetwork Magazine): \u00a0\u00a0 6 eggs \u00a0\u00a0 1 1/2 sticks of butter (cut into small peices plus more for the pan) \u00a0\u00a0 12 oz of bitter sweet chocolate (chopped) \u00a0\u00a0 1/2 cup sugar \u00a0\u00a0 a pinch of kosher salt \u00a0\u00a0 unsweetened coca powder, for dusting\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Step 3: Mise En Place, Tempering, and Eggs!. <PIC> First, you need to preheat an oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit and butter a cake pan (9 inches). Chop the chocolate finely and set out your bowls. It is always good to make sure you have everything orderly and ready to cook before you start cooking. \u00a0 After that, it is time to melt the chocolate by way of double boiling! This is done by putting a pot of water on the stove so the water simmers. Then, place a bowl, filled with the chopped chocolate and butter, that will just lightly sit on above the water. By doing this, the steam created by the heated water is absorbed by the bowl, therefore gradually melting the butter and chocolate. Make sure you stand by the chocolate as this happens, stirring it often, so it does not burn. This entire process can be called conduction. \u00a0 \u00a0 While the chocolate is cooling or if you have a very nice friend, wisk in a seperate bowl (or have someone else do this) the eggs, sugar, and salt.\u00a0 Step 4: Hey Batter, Batter; Hey Batter, Batter... MIX BATTER, MIX!. <PIC> Now that your beautifully smooth chocolate is melted (if it burned try again, making sure you pay even more attention, you have the right bowls, and the heat isn't too high. Good luck!), gently emulsify half of it into the egg mixture. Warning: If the choclate is too hot, your eggs will curdle, which means the will cook rapidly. If this happens you'll have chocolately scrambled eggs, and though that sounds kind of tasty, that is not what we want right now. After you mix half of the chocolate into the egg mixture, 'fold' the rest of the chocolate into it. Then, pour the batter into your prepared pan and put it in your heated oven. Step 5: Baking and Devouring. <PIC> Set a timer for 45 minutes and attempt to patiently wait for your torte to bake, ignoring the delicious smell that will waft from your oven. What you are waiting for is for the oven to use its powers of covection and thermodamics that will result in a puffed cake-like substance that will be a very rich displace of chocolatly goodness. After your timer finaly rings, carefully take your torte out of the oven and let it cool. Don't fret if your torte's top has cracked. That only means that the heat built up inside and escaped because too much pressure was created. It may be a bit drier, but it will still be delicious. Then, the moment you have been waiting for, cut it into peices and devour your creation of fabulous physics! :)", "images_list": ["flourless-chocolate-torte-and-physics_0", "flourless-chocolate-torte-and-physics_2", "flourless-chocolate-torte-and-physics_3", "flourless-chocolate-torte-and-physics_4", "flourless-chocolate-torte-and-physics_5"]}

In a freezer baggie, add 2 tbs. olive oil, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, 3 tbs. root beer, and a splash of Worcestershire Sauce.  Set aside AND marinate the veggies for 15 minutes or more.2.  Skewer each mushroom and red bell pepper onto the end of the rake.  I recommend using 2 wires of the rake for the red bell peppers; this will ensure that they stay on the rake.3.  Place the rake-skewered veggies over peak of the flame.  I used the rocks to create stability of the rake, so that you don't have to hold the rake the entire time.  Cook over high heat for 8-10 minutes.  Coating the mushrooms/peppers with the marinade as they cook.  The sugars in the root beer will caramelize over the flame.  Adjust the rake as needed.  Flip the rake and cook on the other side of the veggies for 8 minutes.  Coat with the marinade.

Step 1: Ingredients and Equipment. <PIC> Ingredients:\n- 1 large or two small apples, peeled cored and diced (and tossed in lemon juice if you're moving slowly)\n- 1 cups softened margarine OR 1 cup butter flavored Crisco + 6 tablespoons water*\n- 1 1/2 cups white sugar or Splenda**\n-  2 eggs\n-  3 cups flour\n-  2 tsp cream of tartar\n-  1 tsp baking soda\n-  1/2 tsp salt\n-  1 cup of carmel bits or cut up carmels\n-  2 tbsp white sugar\n-  2 tsp cinnamon\n*Use margarine if you want a cookie-like texture, use Crisco if you want something more like cake.\n**Replacing some or all of the sugar with Splenda will result in a drier, more biscotti-like texture.\nEquipment:\n-  Standard kitchen gear (bowls, spoons, knives, etc)\n-  Parchment/baking paper\n-  A baking sheet that's about 11 x 16 or so.\n-  A healthy sense of how not to hurt yourself on sharp and hot things while cooking. Step 2: Mix the Dough. <PIC> Preheat the oven to 375.\nBe sure to mix completely before adding the next ingredient!\nMix together the margarine/Crisco and sugar (except for those last 2 tablespoons).\nMix in the eggs.\nMix in the water (if you're using Crisco).\nMix in the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt all at once.\nWithout the mixer (if you've been using one), gently stir in the apple and carmel pieces. Step 3: Preparing to Bake. <PIC> Line the baking pan with parchment paper.\u00a0 The parchment will give the bottom a nice crispiness and will prevent it from sticking to the pan.\nPour out the dough onto the parchment.\u00a0 Use your (clean!) hands and/or a rubber scraper to spread the dough across the pan.\u00a0 It will reach, I\u00a0promise!\u00a0 Just keep working it until it reaches, even if it seems impossibly thin.\u00a0 Make the thickness as even as possible.\nMix together 2 tablespoons of sugar (this is no place for Splenda!)\u00a0and two teaspoons of cinnamon in a bowl.\u00a0 Carefully sprinkle this mix over the entire surface as evenly as possible. Step 4: Baking/Doneness Detection. <PIC> Pop it in the oven and set the timer for 10 minutes.\u00a0 It will probably take about 15.\u00a0 \nIf you've only used sugar (no Splenda) the entire surface will puff up as it bakes.\u00a0 It will then start collapsing from the outer edge toward the center.\u00a0 As soon as the puff is out of it it's done.\u00a0 You can stick a toothpick in it to double check, but it will be perfectly baked. \u00a0Don't wait too long, it will dry out faster than it seems (at which point you should tell everyone that they're bars made for dipping in milk or coffee!)\nIf you've used any Splenda at all the puff and collapse won't reliably happen, so give it 10 minutes, check it with a toothpick in the middle, and pull it when the toothpick comes out clean and it all seems nicely baked and browned around the edges.\u00a0 It will be fairly dry so the exact baking time isn't as critical. Step 5: Serving. <PIC> If you didn't read the introduction, these are delicious while they're warm, but they will crumble quite a bit around the edges.\u00a0 Throw it in a bowl with ice cream and the crumble doesn't matter.\u00a0 Once they're cool they hold together much better, and they're still delicious.\u00a0 Box them up airtight and keep them in the fridge if you won't be eating them for a while, the apple bits will go bad more quickly than your standard chocolate chip or something would.", "images_list": ["carmel-apple-snickerdoodle-bars-with-texture-vari_0", "carmel-apple-snickerdoodle-bars-with-texture-vari_1", "carmel-apple-snickerdoodle-bars-with-texture-vari_2", "carmel-apple-snickerdoodle-bars-with-texture-vari_3", "carmel-apple-snickerdoodle-bars-with-texture-vari_4", "carmel-apple-snickerdoodle-bars-with-texture-vari_5"]}

Yummy, I assure you that! I made my bread not so sweet because I saw recipes on the internet that were stuffed with lots of sugar. I didn\u2019t want that! :) So, I made this stunning & very appetizing pumpkin bread! This is great & tasty enjoyed with the same ginger, cinnamon & cardamom tea in your tea mug!  Check it out for yourself, my lovely ones! ;)Recipe: For 1 pumpkin bread, about 9 thicker slices Ingredients:** The dry ingredients: 1 cup organic light organic spelt flour 1 cup organic wholemeal spelt flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon garam masala ( my garam masala mix has also cardamom in it ) 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, I did it in my pestle & mortar ** The wet ingredients:1 cup + 1/2 cup mashed roasted pumpkin. /I used freezed roasted pumpkin from last year/ I placed it into my microwave to defrost. It defrosted in 8 minutes. Mix through with a spoon & take 1 cup + 1/2 cup. 1 tablespoon canola oil 1/2 cup maple syrup 1 teaspoon vanilla extract/ I use home-made 1 flax egg = to substitute 1 egg/ Grind your 1 tablespoon flaxseed into your grinder & measure out 1 tablespoon. Take this + mix this in a bowl with 3 tablespoons water. Mix with a fork & wait for about 10 minutes until it forms a sort of gel. Now, you can use it. ** The rest: 1 cup yellow dried raisins Step 1: . <PIC> 1. First, soak your yellow raisins in a tea for 30 minutes. I used Pukka-tea : organic cinnamon, ginger & cardamom tea.   Pukka tea: Revitalise! Organic tea with cardamom, ginger & cinnamon!I made my tea by steeping my teabag for 6 minutes into my tea mug. I placed my yellow dried raisins into a medium bowl. I used250 ml tea. I poured the tea onto my yellow dried raisins & let them soak for 30 minutes, to absorb the lovely flavours of my delicious tea so that would be juicy & bigger! After 30 minutes, drain the tea liquid. Place the juicy raisins into a sieve to shake the sieve up & down a bit to shake of any excess of liquid. Step 2: . Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0C ( 350 F ) for 10 minutes. I always use a fan oven. Adjust your oven to the right temperature.In a Kenwood-bowl or a big bowl, sift the light spelt flour, add the wholemeal spelt flour & sieve the baking soda, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, garam masala & the cloves. Mix lightly with a spoon, carefully not to mess with the air! ;), until well combined. In another large bowl, add the wet ingredients. Add pumpkin pur\u00e9e, flax egg, canola oil, maple syrup & vanilla extract. Mix well with a medium whisk.Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients & mix with the K-paddle or mix it by hand or with an electric whisk until all beautifully combined! Spoon with a spatula, everything round & check that you have incorporated everything into your Kenwood bowl. Mix again. Now, add the drained yellow raisins to the batter. Mix on low-speed for a minute or less, or until well mixed into the batter. Step 3: . <PIC> Take your oven rack & place a Silpat for stability. Take your silicon bread pan & you don\u201dt have to grease it because it is silicon. It won\u2019t stick afterwards! Fill it until all of your batter is gone. Smooth the top evenly. Place into the preheated oven on the lower rack of your oven & bake for about 50 minutes or until a pin you put into it, comes out clean. I baked my bread on 180\u00b0C ( 350 F ) for 40 minutes & lowered my oven onto 165\u00b0C ( 329 F ) for about 10 minutes. See that the top of your bread won\u2019t get burned!!! I tested my bread in 3 places & the pin came out clean. Test it into the thickest part 2 times & into the side part, 1 time. Now, remove from the oven & place onto a wire rack for 10 minutes. Than, remove the silicon tin & place onto the wire rack to cool down completely. Store in a cookie or cake tin.Serve with a loved one & drink the same tea with it that you used into your beautiful cake aka bread! This is great on its own or smeared with some vegan butter! ;) MMM!

Make up a batch to keep on hand for sudden cravings, give as favors for your next party, or send to loved ones overseas.  The cakes will remain moist and delicious for up to 6 months!  What better way to show someone you care than a personalized cake in a jar!Check out this amazing story about a 36-year-old government issue cake, and soldier who ate it!For more info on cute jarred treats (and how I prepared the jars), see Pie in a Jar! Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> To speed things along, I used a boxed cake mix.  Everyone agreed it tasted like a boxed cake mix.  I was ok with that for the purpose of illustrating the technique (no need to make this two instructables worth of instructions!) but will definitely go from scratch next time.So find your favorite cake mix and supporting ingredients, or make it from scratch.  The best part about making your own is that you can make half of one kind and half of another!You'll also need a bunch of canning jars - straight sides, wide mouthed.  I got the wee-est ones I could find for cuteness' sake.  You can definitely make them in bigger jars.Boil or wash the jars to sterilize them.  You'll want brand-spanking-new lids to make a tight seal when you're done.The box mix made enough batter to fill 16-20 jars! Step 2: Make Cake Batter. <PIC> Make the batter according to the directions on the box.Or look here for some inspiration to make your own!Fill the jars about half-way with batter.  If you fill them too full, you can always squish them down, or cut the tops off.  But too much batter will result in them flowing over the sides of the jars.Place in a baking dish for ease of handling. Step 3: Bake Tiny Cakes. <PIC> Bake according to directions for cupcakes, and check for doneness.  These are about cupcake size, but your jars may  be larger and need more time.When they're done, close the lids on 'em.  They're self-sealing, and you'll be able to see the seal forming!Alternatively, you can add a chocolate ganache* to the top before sealing.  Make sure to screw those caps on while the cakes are still hot though, to get that all-important seal.* To make ganache: Heat 1 cup cream in a small sauce pan over medium heat. Bring just to a boil, watching very carefully because if it boils for a few seconds, it will boil out of the pot. When the cream has come to a boil, pour over 9oz chopped chocolate, and whisk until smooth. Allow the ganache to cool slightly before pouring over cake.  Step 4: Store or Enjoy. Do Both!. <PIC> This is one little beauty I popped onto a plate - but no need, they're easy to eat right out of the jar!Once you've sealed these little treats, lable and date them.  Then you're ready to serve, ship, or store.Enjoy!UPDATE:According to user precision: \"We've been doing these for years, they are great!

There are burgers on the grill, sodas on ice, and tons of chips.\nThe trouble is, I don't eat meat, and I get stuck trying to microwave something. I like Gardenburgers, but they are expensive, and the ones I find in the grocery store are tiny, so they don't fit well on a bun. I find soy burgers, like the ones from Boca, completely unpalatable.\u00a0\nI decided to make my own vegetarian burgers. I had some specific criteria. The burgers need to have as few ingredients as possible, I must be able to make a bunch and freeze them, and they have to taste good with pickles. I do not want a meat-like burger, just something that can be thrown on the grill.Ingredients:\n2 medium red potatoes\n6 large crimini mushrooms\n1 large egg\n1 tablespoon of flax seed meal\n2 tablespoons of steak sauce\n1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke\nvegetable oilTools:\nfood processor or grater and knife\nmeasuring cups and spoons\nmixing bowl\nmixing spoon/spatula\ncheese cloth\nskillet\ngrill\nparchment or freezer paper\nzippered plastic bag or freezer safe storage container\nThis makes about four burgers. Step 1: Potatoes and Mushrooms. <PIC> Wash the potatoes and mushrooms thoroughly. Scrub the potatoes with a stiff-bristle vegetable brush. Clean the mushrooms with a wet soft cloth or a wet paper towel.\nShred one potato and three mushrooms. Mince the remaining potato and mushrooms.\nUsing the cheese cloth, squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Both potatoes and mushrooms have a lot of natural moisture, and this can make the burgers fall apart.\nPut the shredded and minced potatoes and mushrooms in a large mixing bowl and mix them until they are evenly distributed. Step 2: . <PIC> Add the egg, steak sauce, liquid smoke, and flax seed meal to the mixture, and mix together.\nThe egg and flax meal are to help bind the potatoes and mushrooms together. Vegans can increase the amount of flax and leave out the egg, but you will need to experiment with ratios a bit.\nLiquid smoke and steak sauce are for flavor. Burgers often have\u00a0Worcestershire\u00a0sauce, but this has anchovies in it. Steak sauce is very similar to\u00a0Worcestershire sauce\u00a0in make-up, but it contains no animal products. Step 3: Forming Patties. <PIC> To get consistent patty size, use a scale to measure weight or a measuring cup for volume. I found that a 1/3 cup of the mixture made for a perfect burger for me.\nForm the mixture into a ball and then mash it down on some parchment or freezer paper.\nCook they patty in a skillet with a small amount of vegetable oil for about a minute on each side. This is just to get the outer bits to bond well enough to stay together when you put it on a grill. Step 4: Cooking. <PIC> You can either grill the burger now, or put it back on the parchment or freezer paper, let it cool some, then seal it in a plastic bag or box and freeze it.\nWhen you want a burger, just pull the patty out of the freezer ans slap it on the grill. I found that it took about the same time to cook this as it did to cook a frozen beef patty (about 10 minutes), but it didn't get grill lines the same way.\nThrow a slice of cheese on the patty , let the cheese melt, then add a bun and pickles.

Make sure to use the finger guard and be very careful so you don't cut yourself!\n\t\tPut the slices into the mixing bowl and sprinkle in Bacon Salt (you'll need a lot)\n\t\tToss the slices around with your fingers until all slices are coated on both sides\n\t\tYou can keep the slices in this bowl or transfer them to the draining rack placed over the sheet pan (if using)\n\t\tAllow to sit for at least 30 minutes to allow the bitter fluid to drain from the eggplant Step 3: Fry 'Em Up. <PIC> \n\t\tPour approximately an inch of oil into your cast iron pan and heat over medium-high heat\n\t\tOnce the oil is nice and hot, gently wipe off the extra liquid (and some of the Bacon Salt) from each eggplant slice, add slices one at a time to the oil. Be very careful! The high water content in the eggplant slices will make the oil splatter a lot!\n\t\tFry until crispy and lightly browned all over (or more brown if you like your bacon extra crispy)\n\t\tRemove from pan using tongs and place on a layer of paper towels or brown paper bags to wick away the excess oil\n\t\tEnjoy as is, or make yourself a delicious ELT (eggplant, lettuce, and tomato) sandwich!", "images_list": ["eggplant-bacon_0", "eggplant-bacon_1", "eggplant-bacon_2", "eggplant-bacon_3"]}

Hold the popsicle in place for about 10-15 seconds until the sauce hardens. Move the plate carefully back into the freezer.\nRemove the creamsicles from the freezer about 3-4 minutes minutes before serving.\u00a0\nIf you're making these a day or more in advance, gently wrap each popsicle in plastic wrap and keep frozen.

If you've never done this before, the easiest way to remove the outer skin of a garlic clove is by pressing down on the clove with the flat of the knife blade (or anything else you can smash it with).Salt and pepper the chicken. Step 3: Step 3: Cooking. <PIC> Heat the olive oil in the pan on medium-high.Add the chicken to the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Flipping halfway through.Add the onion and garlic and a pinch of salt. Cook for another two minutes.Add the remaining ingredients (tomato paste, crushed tomato, and red wine vinegar). N.b. For this recipe there will be enough sauce that you could serve this with rice or pasta. If you don't want to do that, you can add only half the can of crushed tomatoes.Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover pan and cook for 9 minutes. Step 4: Step 4: Options. <PIC> Here I've plated the chicken with a simple green salad and finished it with some shredded parmesan. As noted in step three, you could serve this with rice or pasta. In addition, you can modify the flavor profile in any number of ways, so you can think of this as a foundation for a variety of meals. When adding the onions and garlic one might add a variety of spices that would make the meal more reminiscent (though not exactly authentic) of various cuisines--Italian, Greek, Indian, Mexican, etc. Also, when adding the tomatoes one might also add whatever vegetables one has on hand: peppers, broccoli, zucchini, spinach, etc. You'll want to experiment for yourself in terms of your doneness preference. I.e., some of these vegetables don't need to cook for 9 minutes.

If you want to\u00a0successfully\u00a0compete with steak & beer, then you need to bring out the big guns: donuts, bacon and whiskey!Ingredients:Donuts:\ndonut recipe adapted from\u00a0secretdonutrecipe.com\n2 cups flour\n1/2 cup warm mashed potato\n1/2 tsp kosher salt\n1/4 cup sugar\n1 cup warm milk (not hot)\u00a0\npinch of sugar\n5 tsp. yeast\nCanola Oil for frying + 2 tbsp\n1 cup milk\npinch of sugarCandied Bacon\n1/2 cup golden brown sugar\n1/2 to 1 tsp. Cayenne pepper\n8-10 Bacon SlicesWhiskey Glaze\ninspired by Saveur magazine's Maple glaze- I left out the maple syrup & added whiskey\nTo taste- 3-5 tbsp high quality whiskey\n2 cups confectioners sugar\n1/4 cup heavy cream\npinch of kosher salt\n5 tbsp. WhiskeyMake the Dough:\nTo make the\u00a0donuts, start by gathering all the ingredients. The\u00a0donut recipe suggests baking the potato in the microwave, but I boiled mine. Either way will work. Clean and peel your potato. Bake in the microwave for five minutes or boil for 10-15 or\u00a0until\u00a0tender. Mash the potato. You will need 1/2 cup for this recipe.\u00a0\nNext, you need to make a milk mixture by warming 1 cup of milk in the microwave for a few\u00a0seconds\u00a0or on the stove. You want the milk to be slightly warm. Not hot. Once the milk mixture is warm, remove it from the heat and stir in 5 tsp. of yeast and a pinch of sugar. Stir and let the mixture sit for 5 minutes\u00a0until\u00a0it bubbles.\u00a0\nNext, in a kitchen add mixer bowl, \u00a0combine the flour, sugar, salt & potato. Next, add the milk mixture and 2 tbsp. of Canola oil. Using the paddle attachment, knead the dough for three minutes. The dough was really sticky, so I added a few extra tbsp. of flour as needed. \u00a0You can also do this step by hand. Remove the paddle attachment and cover with saran wrap. Place a cool damp cloth over the top allow the dough to rise for at least an hour.\u00a0Make the Candied Bacon:\nPre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. \u00a0Combine 1/2 cup of brown sugar with 1/2- to 1 tsp. pf cayenne in a large bowl. Stir the mixture until no sugar clumps remain. One bacon strip at a time, press one side of the bacon into the mixture and coat it. Place it on a \u00a0baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Repeat with the remaining bacon strips. Bake for 8-12 minutes or until the bacon is\u00a0crispy\u00a0or done to your likeness. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Cut the bacon into bit size pieces.\u00a0Back to the Donuts: Once the dough has risen, punch it down and lightly flour your work surface & rolling pin. Roll the dough out and use a donut cutter or glass to cut out the circles. Allow the dough to rise again while you heat up the oil.\u00a0\nIn a deep cast iron skillet, pour in the canola oil. You don't need to put in too much. Just enough to cover the donuts. The oil should be about 360 degrees. You can do a test run with the donut holes.\u00a0\nPlace the donuts in the oil, three at a time. Flip the donuts over after 8-12 seconds and allow the donut to get golden brown. Remove the donuts with a heat safe spatula and place on a rack to cool.\u00a0Make the Whiskey Glaze:\nCombine whiskey, confectioners sugar, heavy cream & salt in a bowl. Whisk\u00a0until\u00a0smooth.\u00a0Glaze the donuts:\nDip the donuts face down into the glaze and using a circular motion with your wrist, coat the donut.

Granted both blue cheese and celery can be an acquired taste, but for those who are sceptical I urge you to try this out. I had a girlfriend who told me she didn't like either of these core ingredients, but when she tried this soup she loved it and it became a firm favourite.\nIt's a fantastic winter warmer, served topped with crispy bacon and crusty buttered bread roll.\nI first encountered this style of soup in Dorset, UK, where the cheese, 'Blue Vinney', had a stirring myth of once being 'illegal'.\nIt's not a common cheese though, so I often use Stilton, or other crumbly textured blue cheese.\nThis is a simple soup to make, few ingredients to worry about and hard to get wrong. Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> This is a guide for making enough for about 6 people, so adjust the recipe accordingly. You may want to very some of the ingredients depending on your tase and what you have available. I blend this soup so it's smooth, you may not wish to, so I'd recommend chopping the vegetables finely. Feel fre to vary the ingredients, this is just a guide, you may want more celery, leek or cheese. You may also want to leave out certain ingredients like the flour if you have allergies.\n25g butter\n1 tbsp vegetable or other flavourless oil\n1 tbsp plain flour\n1 medium leek, chopped\n6-7 sticks celery chopped\n250g of Blue Vinney (or other crumbly blue cheese, such as Stilton)\n900ml of Vegetable stock (you can use weak chicken stock)\n150-200ml single cream\nOptional:\n6-8 rashers of smokey bacon\n1 medium potato peeled and diced\n1 large onion instead of the leek\nMy leek looked a little ropey, so I used part of that and an onion too. Step 2: The Base. <PIC> \n\t\tHeat the oil and butter together in a good sized cooking pot.\n\t\tAdd the leek, or onion and sweat relatively gently until soft, you don't want it to brown.\n\t\tAdd the celery and potato if using and cook until for a few minutes. (yeah, I forgot the potato, but added it at the next step)\n\t\tTip in the flour, stirring well to coat eveything and cook for a minute of so. This is just there to help thicken the soup, but you do want to cook the flour out or it leaves a chalky taste.\n\t\tNow add the stock and bring to the boil, make sure to scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any flour that may have stuck.\n\t\tCover and simmer for around 30 minutes until the vegetables are soft. Step 3: Finishing Up. <PIC> \n          If you're serving with crispy bacon get a grill preheated to high and cook the bacon until crisp, then sit to dry on some absorbent paper. You could fry it if you like, I just prefer grilling bacon.\n\t\tNow that the stock base is cooked though remove from the heat and stir in the cream. You may want to let the stock cool a little first so it doesn't split, or just stir really quickly.\n\t\tNow crumble in the cheese and stir until it melts, you can return it to a gentle heat to help it along now that the cream has been well mixed, but don't boil it again or it may split.\n\t\tI then like to blend using a hand/stick blender.\nCaution: Keep your fingers away from the business end of the blender! Also try to keep it under the liquid or you'll need to clean it off the walls and will be wearing spatters of boiling cheesy soup!\n         Step 4: Serve. <PIC> I like to present this with long strips of crispy bacon floating on the top with a little drizzle of extra cream and maybe a tiny drizzle of homemade truffle infused oil.\nA warm crispy roll with butter is always a welcome accompaniment", "images_list": ["dorset-blue-vinney-blue-cheese-celery-soup_0", "dorset-blue-vinney-blue-cheese-celery-soup_1", "dorset-blue-vinney-blue-cheese-celery-soup_2", "dorset-blue-vinney-blue-cheese-celery-soup_3", "dorset-blue-vinney-blue-cheese-celery-soup_4"]}

So here you go!!\nI love plum jam (it's pretty much my fave of all). My grand'ma tought me how to do it and since i've done a lot of it last year i've made some pictures to share with you.\nThis is what you need:\n- 3 kg plums\n- 1 kg sugar\n- clean jarsFirst step: is to wash the plums really really good.Second step: you have to peel them off (if the skin doesn't go off easily you can put them into boiling water for less than a minute and take them out and peel them:P - be cautious not to get burnt). I had no need to boil them because with these plums you can take off the skin really easy and pretty fast. Cut the plums and remove the pits.Third step: put the plums into the heavy bottomed pan and pour the sugar on top of it. On a low fire you have to mix the fruits and the sugar with the wooden spoon until the sugar melts. After that you have to turn the fire on and boil the jam, stirring with the wooden spoon. Be cautious because it can splash you and it's really hot. It can take up to two hours until it's ready. I know it;s ready when i can see the buttom of the pan while i stir with the wooden spoon.\nWhen the jam is ready i put a stainless plate under the jar and pour the jam using the wooden spoon into the jar. Than i cover the jar and put a label on it and that's it:D!!\nTnx!

{"id": "RECIPE_2167", "question": "What are the essential steps to prepare a delicious espresso coffee at home?", "provenance": [41389], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Espresso Coffee. <PIC> Tired of spending $3 every morning for your espresso coffee half decaf, low fat, extra foam latte? I was, although I was in between machines as my 10 year old espresso machine died and it took me a while to figure out my upgrade path. My wife speculates that I did about 12 hours of research into finding the perfect espresso machine to buy. I also spent a couple of months testing out the various morning coffee locations and was getting embarrassed by what was coming out of my mouth when I ordered what I thought was a simple drink, but was hard work spitting out without any caffeine.I'll walk you through the basics of espresso coffee and my personal favorite espresso+steamed milk variation, the latte. I will share my hard earned research and tell you the best espresso machine to buy and how I came to that conclusion. Why make your own espresso?For me the main reason was that I couldn't order exactly what I wanted. I needed more control over the amount of caffeine and the espresso to milk/foam ratio.The experience and benefits of making something yourself, no matter how small or trivial, is also something I crave. Starting off the day crafting my drink of choice makes my day that much better.So let's get started. Step 1: Espresso Machines. <PIC> Before getting started on your path to espresso perfection, you're going to need to decide what kind of espresso machine you want to buy. How much should you spend?Let's do the math. My wife and I typically have one latte a day, so at $3, that's $2,190 a year. I expect a quality espresso machine to last at least 10 years and probably more if it's properly maintained. I probably would have spent up to $2-3k if I thought the machine was worth it. I ended up spending about $1,200 for the espresso machine and grinder.There are too many espresso machines to choose from and it's hard to figure out which is the best one. I stayed away from the pod only machines, since I wanted to have control over where I bought my coffee and what kind of coffee I wanted to use. For example the Nespresso machines don't have an option to buy a half decaf pod and each pod costs $.50. Most of these machines won't do much for steaming milk either. I don't like twist off beer caps or screw-off wine caps, so where's the art is throwing in a pod and pressing a button. Not for me thanks.The best espresso machine for your moneyThrough my hours of research on forums, reviews, in store investigations, this is what I bought. RANCILIO SILVIA w/ COMPUTER TEMP (PID)The Silvia is a great machine and the most popular. It's in the ~$600 price range without a temp. control modification. The temperature control is an custom modification to control the temperature of the water. Without the temp. control, the boiler can fluctuate ~40 degrees. You typically need to spend $2000+ for temperature control in an espresso machine, but you can get the Sylvia for less than half of that .  You can also buy kits to do this yourself and there are a number of instructions on how to do this, just google Silvia PID.Now you'll need a grinderI thought I could get away without buying a grinder, but I was wrong, very wrong. You'll need a burr grinder that you can adjust to match your coffee beans. I'll explain this more in the next step, but trust me, don't skimp on the grinder or you'll never be happy with your results. Step 2: Pulling Shots. <PIC> So you've got the gear, let's get started.Turn your machine on and let it warm upThe better the machine, the longer it takes to warm up. Make sure the handle is attached to the unit while it's warming up. You want all the brass to be nice and warm. The Silvia takes about 20 minutes to warm up. Also remember to make sure there is some water in the steam wand by turning it on and letting water run through it. You don't want heating components to be dry as they will get damaged over time. The Silvia can make hot water using the steam wand, so you just turn on the middle switch to run a little water through it. I also use the hot water to heat up my mugs before pulling the shots.Load up your espresso handle with coffeeLevel off any excess coffee before we get to tamping. Here's another item you'll need, a nice tamper. This is what you use to compress the coffee in the espresso handle basket. The Silvia uses a 58mm size tamper. When tamping, use about 30lbs of pressure. If you need a sense of how much pressure that is, try using a bathroom scale and pushing against it. Tap the sides to get any air bubbles out and then finish with a light twisting off motion.Insert espresso handle and start pullingMake sure the handle is properly locked into your machine before hitting any buttons. This is the area you'll need to work on the most. It is supposed to take around 25-30 seconds to pull one ounce of espresso from start to finish. If it comes out too fast, you need a finer grind. If it's too slow, you may need a coarser grind or you may be tamping too hard. If you don't have a good coffee grinder, you may not be able to get the right grind for your machine. Different types of coffees will need different grind settings.Before pulling, you also want to know the temperature of the water. Again, some coffees do better with different temperatures and even 1-2 degrees can make a difference. I'm using 219 degrees right now. You'll just need to experiment and if your machine does not have a temperature control, you can probably find somebody who has 'temp. surfed' it enough to know how to get the appropriate temp. With the Sylvia, you can run the espresso switch, water will come out, way about minute and it will be around 200 degrees. My advice, get a PID unit. Step 3: Milk Frothing. <PIC> If you like cappuccinos and lattes, spend the money and get a quality espresso machine or you won't be satisfied. The Silvia has great steam power and the power to make microfoam. Microfoam just means that the foam has tiny bubbles and it gives it a smooth texture. The only coffee shop that I know of that does microfoam really well, is Peet's coffee.Frothing basicsStart by putting your stainless steel frothing pitcher in the freezer. The colder your milk, the longer you can work with it to get nice foam. Don't use a pitcher larger than 20oz. and don't fill it more than half way. Bleed the steam wand of any water by turning it on and letting the water go out until all you have is steam. Place the pitcher of milk at a slight angle and insert the wand just under the surface. When you turn the steam on, turn it on until you stop hearing any really loud whining. The surf the tip just at the top of the milk. You want to get some air into the milk without creating large bubbles. You can hear the air getting sucked in as you do it. If there are huge bubbles, lower the tip into the milk.When the temperature is at 100 degrees sink the tip into milk and get it swirling. This creates finer bubbles with the air that you already got into the milk and is the path to microfoam. Microfoam is not easy and has a lot of subtleties that you'll need to work out by trial and error. I have just ordered a thicker gauge frothing pitcher to try out. I'll follow up if it helps.Clean the steam wand!After you are done frothing, wipe the wand with a wet rag or sponge. If you leave the milk on there, it's a real pain to get off later.Here's a short video to help with the sound and tip placement.", "images_list": ["espresso-coffee_0", "espresso-coffee_1", "espresso-coffee_2", "espresso-coffee_3"]}

This is an instructable about the very dark, robust type of ryebread that is very popular here in Denmark.\nIt is a healthy alternative to white bread, containing lots of fibres, and being more dense and compact, which saves space in the lunchbox.\nWe here in Denmark traditionally have rather fat and unhealthy foods, but one thing we do have, which is suitable for the modern way of living healthy, is this ryebread.\nI did however find, when I\u00a0went to Seattle last year, that at least most Americans do not know about this high-fiber type of bread.\nInstructables.com, which seems to have mostly american users, with a strong focus on health, seemed like a perfect place to introduce it.\nI have been eating this type of bread my whole life, and therefore I'm used to it, so this is also a test to see if anyone who is not used to it, will actually find it tasty.\nThis instructable will be a recipe for a very basic type of ryebread.\nIt will be of a somewhat simple, somewhat quick-to-do, somewhat healthy, and somewhat tasty type.\nThe reason for this is that you can tweak and change the recipe in a thousand ways, and I am hoping that some of you will come to like it, and experiment with it, until you find the combination YOU\u00a0like the best. I\u00a0will have a list of possible extra ingredients and combinations at the end of the instructable. Step 1: Ingredients and Tools. For this basic recipe we will be using the following ingredients:\n- 3/4Liters/0.2Gallons Water- 35g/1.3oz Yeast- 225g/8oz Rye Grains. chopped / broken- 225g/8oz Wheat Grains. whole / cracked- 75g/2.6oz Syrup, dark*- 35g/1.3oz Salt- 450g/16oz Rye Flour, coarse- 225g/8oz Wheat flour\n* Normal sugar can be used as a substitute.\nNote: I'll be using wheat bran, as I forgot wheat grains, whoops... :(\nWe will also be using these tools:\n- Big Bowl for mixing\n- Something to stir with\n- Forms for the bread*\n- Scale\n- Measuring Cup\n* For a good form, use one for wheat bread, or a ceramic casserole, whatever you like.\nJust remember to grease it if it does not have anti-stick-coating.\nI used 2 forms, but the breads came out too small, so this recipe is for 1 bread. Step 2: Yeast in Water. Dissolve the yeast in hand-warm water.\nSurely part of baking 101, but I will just note it anyway.\nIf the water is too cold or warm to yeast will die, and the bread won't rise, giving a rock-hard result.\nSo feel the water with your hand or wrist. It has to be comfortably warm, not too cold for a bath, but not as hot as you probably like it when taking a bath ;) Step 3: Mix It All In. Just add in the rest of the ingredients, but do not start with the salt.\nThe salt might inhibit or kill some of the yeast, if mixed in too early.\nAfter mixing the ingredients, check if the thickness of the dough is as it should be.\nA\u00a0nice way to test it is to place the spoon upright in the middle of the dough. If it tilts slowly, its perfect.\nAdjust the dough with a little rye flour or a little water. Step 4: Rising. Put the dough in the form(s). Remember to grease them if they do are not coated with teflon or the alike.\nSoak and wring a towel so that it is just damp. Cover the form(s) with it, and leave for 12 hours. Step 5: Baking. Preheat your oven to 170C/338F.\nPlace the bread in the lower half of the oven, and bake for 1:15 hours.\nTo get the bread out of the form, either use a butterknife, or turn the form upside down, and let cool a bit. Then shake the form until the bread lets go.\nIf the bread is not crusty on the sides, place it without the forms in the oven for 10-15 minutes.\nLeave the bread to rest for 6-12 hours (Actually, it's hard to slice until it's a day old).\nIf the crust is too hard, cover it with a damp towel, otherwise, cover it with a dry one.\nThat's it, now you have some healthy grainy bread. Hope you like it! Step 6: Variants. Here is the fun part. You can add all kinds of extra ingredients, or replace some of those already in the bread, with alternatives.\nFor extra texture:\nSeeds:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sunflower seeds\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pumpkin seeds\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Linseed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sesame seeds\nNuts:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chopped Hazelnuts\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chopped Almonds\nOther:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oatmeal\nStudies have shown that the oils from seeds are only partly digested, so they \"don't count as much\" as oil from nuts.\nFor different taste and consistency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Replacing wheat flour with coarse wheat flour\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using only rye flour\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Replace the wheat flour with brans, or just add brans to the mix\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using beer or milk instead of the water\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Add yoghurt\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Add grated carrots\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Replace yeast with sourdough\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nActually, \"REAL\" ryebread is made by using only rye flour (replacing the wheat flour with same amount of rye flour), and is made on sourdough, not yeast!\nAlso, for a super healthy, super dark, super grainy superbread, add the 4 types of seeds, replace the wheat flour with different brans, and replace the syrup with artificial sweetener.\nFor a more \"light\" kind of bread, use 50/50 rye and wheat flour, add carrots, 1\u00bd cups of mixed seeds, and a small cup of chopped nuts.\nI usually just mix in the extra ingredients \"on the feel\", but if there is something you would like to try and you would like some concrete guidelines, let me know in the comments.\nThen I'll find and translate a recipe with the ingredients you would like.\nEnjoy!", "images_list": []}

Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> For the Ravioli:\nWon Ton Wrappers, buy the thickest ones you can find. \u00a0I got mine at the asian grocery store\nTrader Joe's Roasted Mashed Sweet Potato\nNote, these cooking amounts are approximate, this is where you can just use your eye and keep tasting to create a sauce that is sweet and spicy to your taste.\nFor the Sauce:\n2/3 C Coconut Milk\n1 TB Curry\nA few Shakes of Red Pepper Flakes\n1 TSP Soy Sauce\n1 TSP Black Vinegar\nA few shakes of Garlic Salt\nPepper to taste\n2 TB Brown Sugar\n1 TSP Sesame Seed Oil\n3 TB Corn Starch\nWater Step 2: Start Making the Ravioli. <PIC> Lay out some won ton skins\nNuke 2 of the sweet potato \"pucks\" at a time for about 20 seconds\nPut half of a puck worth of sweet potato on the skin and use your fingers to put some warm water around it.\nSeal the second wonton skin on top.\nNow if you're not into cute ravioli, you can stop here, this makes a fine ravioli, but I wanted to go a step further and make Hello Kitty ravioli, so if you're into cute, go to the next step. Step 3: Make the Ravioli Cute. <PIC> Using a cookie cutter, cut out the shape. \u00a0This also helps seal the edges.\nWhen you're done cutting you can use your fingers to squeeze the edges sealed even better, before laying it on a tray to rest. Step 4: Cooking the Sauce and Ravioli. <PIC> Start a pot of boiling water on your back burner.\nOn the front burner combine the following:\n2/3 C Coconut Milk\n1 TB Curry\nA few Shakes of Red Pepper Flakes\n1 TSP Soy Sauce\n1 TSP Black Vinegar\nA few shakes of Garlic Salt\nPepper to taste\n2 TB Brown Sugar\n1 TSP Sesame Seed Oil\nNext combine in a measuring cup\n3 TB Corn Starch\nWater\nWhile the sauce heats up, and you have your corn starch mixture fully mixed, slowly pour it into the sauce, while stirring. \u00a0The heat and the cornstarch will quickly thicken. You won't need that entire amount of 3TB of cornstarch necessarily, so stop when you get a thick enough sauce to your taste. \u00a0If you over add, you can add in some more coconut milk to thin it out a bit. \u00a0I did that and then added in another shake of garlic salt to take the sweetness down a notch.\nWhen your sauce is done you can turn off the heat and start cooking your ravioli.\nUsing a slotted spoon, gently put your ravioli into the boiling water. \u00a0Do a maximum of 6 in a pot, but make sure to put in one, and gently stir, and then add the next one, so they don't all stick together, or to the bottom of the pot. \u00a0Cook for 3 minutes. \u00a0The reason for the max of 6 is that your ravioli will slow the boil down. \u00a0Since they cook so quickly it's no big deal to do several batches.\nOnce they're done, use a slotted spoon to gently remove them and drain out the water. Step 5: Plate and Enjoy!. <PIC> I like to put a base of sauce on my plate, put about 3 ravioli and then put sauce on top.\nThis is an incredibly flavorful sauce, so you do not want to put on too much or it will overwhelm the ravioli.\nChef's notes: While you could actually fit a frozen sweet potato puck into a circular ravioli if you are not going to use a cookie cutter, I don't recommend it. \u00a0I tried that first and the amount of sweet potato was not in a good ratio to that of the pasta and the sauce. \u00a0It certainly is easier, but for me, it was too much sweet potato.\nEnjoy your Hello Kitty Shaped Sweet Potato Ravioli with Coconut Curry Sauce!", "images_list": ["sweet-potato-ravioli-with-coconut-curry-sauce_0", "sweet-potato-ravioli-with-coconut-curry-sauce_1", "sweet-potato-ravioli-with-coconut-curry-sauce_2", "sweet-potato-ravioli-with-coconut-curry-sauce_3", "sweet-potato-ravioli-with-coconut-curry-sauce_4", "sweet-potato-ravioli-with-coconut-curry-sauce_5"]}

Step 1: Supplies. <PIC> This recipe is really simple and you can just use your leftover spaghetti sauce. \u00a0This time we made the sauce special. Supplies: Spaghetti sauce Ground Turkey or Beef (we cooked up a pound and a quarter since that is how it came, but only used half.) Cheese Bread (we made italian seasoning bread in our bread maker) Garlic Salt (not shown; for seasoning the meat) Oil (for the pan to cook ground turkey) Utensils: Frying Pan Baking Sheet Wooden Spoon Cheese Grater Plates and forks for eating Step 2: Cook Your Meat, Shred Your Cheese. <PIC> You will need to preheat the oven to about 300 degrees. Do this whenever, depending on how long it takes to heat up. We have a gas stove and it seems to get pretty hot pretty quick. Put oil in the frying pan and fry up your ground turkey. Once the meat is completely cooked, (we drain the excess water from the cooked ground turkey and added in garlic salt to the cooked meat before adding the sauce) add in the sauce and cook until the sauce is hot. While doing this, shred the cheese (or cut it up if you would like to just put on slices, I feel shredded melts better) and cut up the bread (if this isn't already done). Step 3: Prepare Your \"Pizzas\". <PIC> Lay the slices on the pan and put the sauce/meat on them. Sprinkle on your cheese and put it in the oven. Cook them until the cheese is melted and the bread is getting toasty. We cooked them for about 7 to 8 minutes. Step 4: Enjoy. <PIC> Pull them out of the oven and put them on plates.

I mean, they're delicious. But have you ever even dreamed about almond butter chips? Well, even if you didn't, I did for you, and I have something delicious to offer up: a recipe for DIY almond butter chips. This tutorial was originally seen on CakeSpy. Step 1: Assemble Your Ingredients. <PIC> You'll need: 1/3 cup almond butter1 tablespoon softened unsalted butter 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar 1-2 tablespoons milk pinch sea salt Step 2: Mix Your Ingredients. . <PIC> In a large bowl (or in a stand mixer) cream the almond butter, butter, and confectioners' sugar until everything comes together. Chances are it's a somewhat mealy mixture.Now, pause your mixing and add the milk, a touch at a time, until niiiiice and creamy and as smooth as it can be considering the texture of the almond butter. It should be thick, but have a consistency where you feel like you can pipe it. I say 1-2 tablespoons of almond butter because you may not need it all. Oh, and stir in that salt. It makes the morsels extra-royale tasty. Step 3: Load the Mixture Into a Bag and Pipe. <PIC> Go ahead and load the mixture into a piping bag or a ziploc bag with a corner cut off (as you can see the corner is not yet cut off in my picture). Pipe onto a parchment-lined or silicone sheet.  Step 4: Freeze Before Using. <PIC> Place the finished morsels in the freezer until completely set; store in an airtight container in the freezer until ready to use.Note: These chips/morsels make a fantastic dessert topping, a tasty snack by the handful, and they can be used for baking. They don't hold their shape quite as well as store-bought peanut butter or chocolate morsels, but as long as they are frozen before being added to a cookie dough, they will hold their shape. To illustrate, here is an I've added a photo of a cookie that I baked with some of the morsels on top.

They are so fudgy, chocolatey and decadent and as far as I know my friends love them as well. So I thought that I would give my friend Vlady a jar full of brownie ingredients for Christmas! It is such a simple and lovely gift to make and receive because then you they can make brownies whenever they want! This recipe makes quite a large brownie 20cmx28cm brownie tin.It is a visually appealing gift and who wouldn\u2019t love to receive brownie mix as a present?? Step 1: Ingredients and Equipment. <PIC> Ingredients-3/4 Cup white sugar-3/4 Cup brown sugar-3/4 Cup plain flour-3/4 Cup cocoa powder (unsweetened)-1/2 Cup white chocolate chips-1/2 Cup milk chocolate chipsEquipment-       1 Litre glass jar-       1-2 Plastic zip lock bags-       1 Large spoon + 1 medium spoon-       Red or Colourful felt/ material-       1 Rubber Band-       Black Thread-       Small card (for writing baking instructions)-       Pen Step 2: Attach Card to Jar. <PIC> Cut a small hole in the card. The best place is along the fold of the card then feed some thread through the hole and place a rubber band on the thread. tie a knot in the thread.  Place the lid on top of the jar and put your chosen material on top. Then secure this in place with the rubber band and card. Remove the decorated lid and prepare the dry ingredients to be added. Step 3: Make the Instruction Card. <PIC> With the attached card make sure to include the following information. Preheat your oven to 160 degrees Celsius  for a fan forced oven.  Grease and line a 20cmx28cm brownie tin. In a large bowl whisk together the contents of the jar then add 3 beaten eggs, 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup vegetable oil and mix until well combined.  Then bake in the oven for 35-45 minutes until a wooden skewer comes out clean.  Step 4: Layer the Ingredients in the Jar. <PIC> This is a really simple gift to make but there are a few tricks that I have found when making these brownie jars. It is really important to put the finer ingredients like caster sugar in the jar first. If you put it above the cocoa powder it can sift through it, mixing up the layers. So To start I place the caster sugar in a ziplock bag and pour it to the bottom of a clean 1 liter jar to make it relatively flat.  Then with a spoon place the cocoa powder on top of the sugar and pat it down flat. Then add the plain flour on top of the cocoa powder and flatten it down. Then add the brown sugar on top of all the rest of the layers and flatten this down, brown sugar will require more flattening than the other layers. Then finally add the chocolate chips on top. Step 5: Seal the Jar. <PIC> Once your ingredients are in the jar tightly close the lid and do any further decorations you desire (You could draw on it with colourful markers of paint).This is such a great gift to make and you can use any left over fabric or cards for decorations.  You can even get kids to help out with this and alternatively you could make smaller jars but you would need to alter the added eggs, butter and oil accordingly.I also would recommend adding some sort of nut like macadamia or walnuts when cooking the brownies if you like nuts.", "images_list": ["brownies-in-a-jar_0", "brownies-in-a-jar_1", "brownies-in-a-jar_2", "brownies-in-a-jar_3", "brownies-in-a-jar_4", "brownies-in-a-jar_5"]}

I like how it tastes, I like how it is nurturing and I like how cooking it is this stupid soup-cooking-activity where my brain can relax and I get a yummy meal from it without worry.  Unlike most water-y soups, it is an actual meal. Since it is a soup with little water, most people would call that a stew, but when I hear \u2018stew\u2019 it makes me think of a slow cook dish and \u2018the soup\u2019 is far away from that. Timing-wise it is organized in a way that you chop veggies, throw them in a pot, clean the work-space, and have food, no pre-cooking and no waiting, which leads to the relaxed-ness of the undertaking.Making variations easily leads to enough variety that I cook it maybe tree times a week. I eat paleo, but you can easily adapt it for vegans or people with autoimmune protocol. And of course you can adapt it to your taste. Depending on how much carbohydrates you want to have in your food, you\u2019ll have more or less potatoes (or sweet potatoes). Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> frying fat, I use coconut oilonions ground meat, ca 150 grams per person (or miso for vegan version) vegetables, about 1.5 cups per person. I like carrots, celery, sweet potatoes, potatoes, leek, cabbage, beet root, and I go for the veggies of the season. root vegetables are very practical because they don\u2019t overcook (unlike for instance bell pepper) spices, currently I like cumin, caraway and coriander seeds, but it is interesting trying new ones every now and then if you like: hot pepper or garlic salt, pepper And a large pot with lid, a chef knife and a cutting board. Step 2: Cooking. <PIC> chop onionsheat oil in pot. use enough fat that you will be deep-frying your spices add spiced that can take heat. cumin, caraway and coriander definitely can take heat, but if for instance you want to have basil in your food, that would be one of the last things to add after a few seconds of spices-frying, add the onion sort your veggies. which takes how long to cook? some veggies need to be cooked, like potatoes, with some that is much less critical, like carrots, some cook fast, like leek, and some just taste better when they have cooked thoroughly, like cabbage. when the onions are somewhat fried/deep fried, add the ground meet and let it all fry into a delicious soup-base.while it fries, chop your veggies in sizes that fit on a spoon. start with the ones that need longest to cook. amongst the vegetables I mentioned above I would do this order: cabbage, potatoes, celery, beet root, carrots, sweet potato, leek, though that is hypothetical, I don\u2019t have dishes that have potatoes and sweet potatoes in them. If for instance I would add a bell pepper, I would do that between the sweet potato and the leek. sweet potatoes cook much faster than potatoes and they fall apart when overcooked. you\u2019ll figure it out with your favorite vegetables. usually I have one or two bowls where I store cut veggies. when the meat is fried to your satisfaction, add water about two centimeters high and some salt (you know how much salt you like in your food, right?) in the pot if you are doing a vegan version and use miso, add that with the water and mix it so that the miso spreads well in your soup start throwing your chopped veggies into the pot, starting with what needs most cooking  keep chopping all your veggies and throwing them into the pot and make sure that there is always a bit of water in the pot. we are doing steam cooking here, steam requires water .hot pepper or garlic? you decide! I like both but only either hot pepper or garlic. what ever you choose, add it with your veggies. if I use garlic I usually add it by the end because then it tastes more garlic-y if you make your soup with tomato, add herbs de provence with the tomatoes in the end Step 3: Cleaning. When all your veggies are in the pot, mix it and turn the heat down a bit so it can settle. Clean your work-space, your knife, throw the peels into the bio bin and set the table. Step 4: Eating.

If using frozen berries, thaw and drain juice before adding berries to the dry ingredients.  Making a \u03c0 symbol is easy to do.  Cut a thin slice of an apple with a small paring knife to get the correct shapes and gently press  the pi shape on top of the fruit/nut/spice mixture.Bake 375 degrees F. for 40-45 minutes, 5-10 minutes longer if baking in a glass dish.  I coated the edge of the pie crust with softened butter to give the crust an extra flaky texture, but this is optional.  Since the fruit often bubbles over the edge of the dish as it bakes, it's a good idea to put a baking pan under the pie to catch the sugary drips.

The problem family packs are cheaper per cut, but what do you do? Cook all four pieces of meat, and hope you eat them before they go bad. Or freeze them hoping they don\u2019t get freezer burn before you can separate them without using an 18 pound sledgehammer.This works if you are married with children or single and buy a 4 pack of chops or you buy a 10 pound ribeye roast and cut it into stakes, instead of paying $10 a pound you can end up paying as little as $3 a pound for prime cuts. Step 1: Be Green. <PIC> I\u2019m big on reduce reuse and recycle so I am sure if you are single you recognize this, a potato chip bag. You can use simple wax paper or the bags in your cereal boxes but I find chip bags work best at not sticking to the meat.Start by opening the bag so it can be flatten, washed, and let dry. Step 2: Wrapping Time. <PIC> Although you are wrapping the meat in an air resistant wrapper after freezing you will be removing the meat one cut at a time. Something like freezer safe Tupperware or a Ziploc bag will work as long as it is a re-sealable container. The container keeps the wrapping together as well.Place the first cut of meat on the end of the flattened chip bag and role the bag 1 turn until you cannot see the meat.Repeat this process for the rest of the cuts of meat. Step 3: Freeze. <PIC> Once you have rolled up the meat in the wrapping press out as much air as you can and fold the ends under the meat placing it in your freezer safe container and freeze.The reason you fold the ends under the meat, is the weight of the meat holds the ends of the wrapping closed in the container. Step 4: Time to Cook. <PIC> Whether it is a day or a month later you take the container out of the freezer and unwrap the cuts of meat one at a time looking as if you just bought it.", "images_list": ["freezing-singles_0", "freezing-singles_1", "freezing-singles_2", "freezing-singles_3", "freezing-singles_4"]}

Step 1: PREPARE & BAKE GF GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST. <PIC> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.YOU WILL NEED:! Box (7.5 oz) *Gluten-free Cinnamon Graham Crackers (I used Pamela's Brand) 6 ounces Unsalted Butter at room temperature 1 12-cup Muffin pan A Food Processor*You will need about 2 cups of crumbled graham crackers to proceedINSTRUCTIONS:Put the graham crackers into the food processor, breaking them up into big pieces as you do so. Pulse the broken crackers as many times as needed to crumble them into fairly big crumbles. Add the 6 TBS's of softened butter and blend (pulse) until you have a well-blended mixture of moist crumbles (blend until you can \"clump\" some of the mixture between your fingers). Place approximately 1 rounded TBS of the mixture into each of the muffin cups and press down firmly with your fingers. Bake the crust for about 8 minutes (or until evenly browned); remove from oven and allow to cool while you make the filling (allow to cool completely; about 1 hour).*In about 1 hour you will need a 300 degree F oven, so either shut your oven off now, or reduce the temperature to 300 degrees F and hold it there until you are ready to fill and bake the cheesecakes. Step 2: PREPARE THE CHEESECAKE FILLING. <PIC> Preheat oven to 300 F.Fill an oven-proof dish with 2 cups of water and place it on the bottom rack of the oven.  (This will help to keep the mini-cheesecakes from cracking).INGREDIENTS FOR THE CHEESECAKE FILLING:4 ounces Cream Cheese at room temperature  2/3 Cup Chocolate-flavored Sweetened Condensed Milk  1/2 Cup Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese  1/2 Cup Italian-style Marscapone Cream Cheese  2 teaspoons Pure Vanilla Extract  2 Large Eggs (I prefer organic cage-free brown eggs)  1/2 teaspoon fresh Orange ZestINSTRUCTIONS:Place the cream cheese in the bottom of a large mixing bowl and mash it down a bit with a fork.  Pour the Chocolate-flavored Condensed Milk over the cream cheese and beat until smooth.  Add the Ricotta and Marscapone cheeses and the Vanilla Extract and beat again until smooth.  Add the eggs, 1 egg at a time, beating each time until the egg is well blended into the mixture.  Add the Orange Zest, mix just until well blended, then ladle the mixture over the graham cracker crusts,filling each cup almost to the top.  Just before putting the muffin pan in the oven I got the bright idea to sprinkle some chocolate chips onto of each filled muffin cup.  Place the muffin pan on the upper oven rack and bake at 300 degrees F for 18 to 20 minutes (the cheesecakes should be slightly \"jiggly\" around the center, but firm around the sides when done - mine took 18 minutes).Remove muffin pan from the oven and allow to cool on a rack until cool enough to place in the refrigerator; then refrigerate for at least 6 hours before glazing with the ganache (see next step) - I covered the muffin pan and left it in the refrigerator overnight.  When the mini cheesecake muffins were first removed from the oven, they were nice and \"puffy.\" bit after a few minutes they deflated somewhat. . .that is to be expected! Step 3: PREPARE THE GANACHE AND GLAZE THE MINI MUFFINS. <PIC> INGREDIENTS:1/2 Cup Heavy Whipping Cream  1 Cup White Chocolate Chips  1/2 Cup Whole Berry Cranberry SauceINSTRUCTIONS:Mix the Whipping Cream & Chocolate chips together in a microwaveable bowl and microwave on high for 30 seconds.  Remove from microwave and stir; if the mixture is not smooth, microwave for another 15 or 20 seconds.    Remove the chilled muffins from the refrigerator and drop a little off the whole cranberry sauce onto the top of each muffin; then cover with the White Chocolate Ganache, letting some run down the sides.NOTE:  I was experimenting here.  I dropped a little Whole Cranberry Sauce onto the top of 1/2 of the muffins, and sprinkled some more chocolate chips on the other half; then I covered them with the ganache. I felt that they looked a little dull, so I added some more cranberry sauce and chips to the tops of the muffins and I think this really enhanced their appearance. This recipe is a variation of the ganache recipe that I found online at:  http://www.acupofmascarpone.com/2012/11/chocolate-cranberry-fudge-cake-with.html Step 4: TIME FOR DESSERT . . .. <PIC> A rich finishing touch to a great Holiday Dinner!I have estimated the nutrition for this recipe to the best of my ability using the MyFitnessPal Recipe Analyzer.

{"id": "RECIPE_2233", "question": "What is the process for creating a brew bucket for fermenting your own beverages at home?", "provenance": [41437], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Brew Bucket. <PIC>   I am making this instructable because I was about to buy some of these 3.5 gallon fermenting buckets online for about $15 + shipping. Good thing I didn't because I was able to go to home depot and make them for half the price.  I mainly use 6.5 gallon glass carboys because I make large 10 gallon batches of beer but sometimes making 3 gallons inside the house is nice. These are also convenient to clean when making all fruit wines that usually have large chunks.  \u00a0 Step 1: Food Safe Plastic. <PIC>   I know many people out there are concerned about the plastic being food safe like the ones at your local home brew shop. The plastic buckets that I purchased are the same type of plastic.  HDPE (high density polyethylene) is used in milk, juice and water containers in order to take advantage of its excellent protective barrier properties. Its chemical resistance properties also make it well suited for items such as containers for household chemicals and detergents. Most five gallon food buckets are made from HDPE. Examples: Milk bottles, shopping bags.  There had been extensive discussion on your favorite home brew forums on this very topic. I personally feel that it is safe but if you do not want to use this plastic that is completely up to you.  \u00a0 Step 2: List of Materials and Tools. <PIC>   To make a plastic bucket you will need:  -- a plastic bucket (I used a 3.5 gallon)  -- a plastic bucket lid (5 gallon fits on my bucket. I also purchased one with a gasket)  -- a rubber grommet (3/8 in)  -- power drill  -- drill bits  \u00a0 Step 3: Building. <PIC>   To build this bucket all you really have to do is drill a hole in the bucket so that it will accept the grommet. To do this first drill a small pilot hole to guide the larger drill bit. I used a 1/8 then made a larger hole with a 7/16 bit. The 7/16 bit was still slightly small so I reamed it out with a knife until I got a snug fit when the airlock was on there. Learn from my mistake and do not force the airlock into the hole if it is too small. I ripped my first grommet.  \u00a0 Step 4: Finished Bucket. <PIC>   This is the finished product. I decided to make two of these. It only takes a few minutes to make. I know that it is not rocket science but sometimes if this simple information is not out there, people will not even try to make it themselves.  \u00a0 Step 5: Brewing Something. I initially did not put this step in but if you are new to home brewing you might want a few recipes to get you started. The recipes will be very crude but they will work. If you want better instructions there are many good instructables on brewing wine or beer. You can use any yeast to brew beer but I recommend using brewers yeast. Bread yeast is easy to find but gives a distinctive bread/yeast flavor that is not pleasant when brewing. I have many recipes on brewing beer, wine and soda on my pinterest if you are interested\u00a0http://www.pinterest.com/xmobisx/ For all these recipes you should sanitize all equipment that will be in contact with the ingredients.\u00a0Basic Mead Recipe -- 10 pounds of honey -- \u00a02 gallons of water -- Handful of raisins -- Yeast Place 2 gallons of water into a large pot and heat until boiling. Once the water comes to a boil turn off the heat and add the honey. Mix well until all the honey is dissolved. Let this mixture cool until it is below 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the mixture has cooled place it into the bucket with the yeast. Place the lid on the Bucket and attack airlock. Let this sit for a month. Once the month is up you can bottle it. The longer the wine ages the better it will taste.Basic Fruit Juice Wine -- 3 gallons of fruit juice( 100% juice without preservatives) -- 4 pounds of sugar (white, brown, granulated...any) -- handful of raisins -- Yeast Place juice into bucket and add yeast. Then attach lid with airlock and let sit for at least a month. After a month it should be ready to bottle. The longer it ages in the bottles the better it will taste.\u00a0", "images_list": ["brew-bucket_0", "brew-bucket_1", "brew-bucket_2", "brew-bucket_3", "brew-bucket_4"]}

Just this once, I was prepared and did not have to run out midway - thanks to my previous pumpkin torte success/debacle, I had already purchased heavy whipping cream.The Hardware2 9\" round cake pansbig mixing bowl - or three, if you don't want to wash between steps2 smaller bowlsA marvelous electric mixer - if not, then a sturdy spoon, lots of patience, and serious biceps.a long serrated knifea rubber spatulaa wide dull knife (aka frosting spatula)The Cake Ingredients3 cups all purpose flour2 teaspoons baking soda2 teaspoons baking powder1 15 oz. can pumpkin pie filling***1/2 cup sugar1 1/4 cup vegetable oil4 large eggsThe Frosting Ingredients1 1# box powdered sugar1/2 cup + 1Tbsp heavy whipping cream1 tsp vanilla extract1 8oz. package cream cheese, room temperature1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature***The original recipe called for pure pumpkin , 1 1/2 cup sugar, and a host of spices.   To save time, I hacked it and used Libby's pie filling, decreasing sugar.  It worked. Step 1: The Cake Batter. <PIC> First, we assemble the cake.  Preheat the oven to 350.  Make sure the racks are centered - too high or too low and your cake will burn, baby, burn.  Butter and flour the two cake pans, tapping out excess flour.  This will enable your cakes to pop out nicely when done.  I didn't actually have to do this because I have special nifty pans with arms that cut and relaease the bottoms.  However, in the interest of instruction, I have shown this step for those of you who probably don't have weird kitchen gadgetry.Whisk the first three ingredients in a large bowl.  Realize you want to use this bowl for the next step and transfer the flour mixture to one of the cake pans temporarily.  Alternately, start out using an extra bowl.  Sigh.  Using electric mixer (see note on previous step under \"Hardware\") beat pumpkin, sugar, and oil in large bowl.  I happen to have hazelnut oil, so I substituted about a 1/4 cup of it for some of the vegetable oil - should add a subtle flavor without changing the cake structure.  Feel free to experiment, just don't change the total amount of oil.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating to incorporate between additions.  Here the recipe called for 2 tsps of orange peel.  Bleah.  I skipped that and added some lemon peel instead.  Your cat will be supervising, so make sure no fur gets in the food.  Ugh.   Add flour mixture and beat on low speed just enough to blend it.  You want a light cake and beating the devil out of it will increase gluten production making for a more, ah, tough chewy cake.  Can we say, \"gross\"?  Now that the batter is ready, divide it equally into the prefloured and now empty cake pans.Bake the batter until a toothpick inserted comes out clean - 35 minutes in my oven.  Cool the cakes in pans for 10 minutes or so, then flip them out (nice to have a cooling rack for this) and turn them top side up to cool completely.During the cooking time, you may realize the can of pumpkin filling you purchased was overly large.  Since you have excess, you should utilize it by attempting the pumpkin torte again.  Hey!  By the time the cakes are done, you can toss it into the oven preheated to the same cooking temperature.  What else to do on a rainy day but bake?  Certainly not going to vaccuum... Step 2: The Frosting. <PIC> Cake is good, yes, but cake with frosting is better.  So make some frosting.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup powdered sugar over the bottom of a small skillet, cooking on medium heat until sugar melts. No need to stir yet, but I'm serious about the medium heat.  Don't burn the sugar with impatience.  Once melted, you can stir as needed, watching for a color change to amber - a coupla minutes.  Now, stir in 1/2 cup cream, vanilla, and salt.  (Useful to already have this mess mixed and ready to pour).  The goo is going to bubble like a witches cauldron.  Whee!  Stir some more, dissolving any hard bits.  Stir in that last teaspoon of cream, and let cool to room temperature in a small bowl.  You have just made candy.On to the next.  Using the electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter in a large bowl.  Gradually beat in powdered sugar.  How much?  Well....I went off the recipe because I started with a big container of powdered sugar instead of a 1# box.  Guesstimating as I mixed, I just kept adding sugar until the frosting attained a frostinglike stiffness.  Realizing I would be adding soupy caramel, I aimed for extra stiffness.  Then I began beating in the cooled caramel.  This is where you can really go to town with an electric mixer.  Whip it!Time to put completed frosting into a small bowl, cover it and chill it until spreadable.  Coupla hours.  One of the pix is finished frosting - the leftovers, that is.  It'll be used to make sandwiches out of  the cake tops that get cut off in the following step.  Waste nothing.              Step 3: Assemble the Layers. <PIC> In order for your cake to have a uniform appearance, the layers need to be even.  Cut the rounded tops off carefully using a loooong serrated knife.  Be careful. I don't think anyone has posted an Instructable for reattaching lost fingers.  Perhaps my next burning question?Place 1st  cake layer on a plate, cut side up.  Spread about a 1/4 of the frosting on the top.  Begin with a big glop in the center and gently work your way out using a frosting spatula or a very wide dull knife.  Go all the way to the edge, maybe a little over.  Trip over the dogs(large) on the way to grabbing the second cake.  Curse and grab your toes, hopping up and down.  Place the 2nd cake, cut side down, over the frosted layer.  Frost the top first, and then the sides, smoothing to your satisfaction.  I added some dried cherries and cranberries for decoration - use your imagination and be inventive with presentation.Survey the enormous mound of dirty kitchenware with trepidation, and long for a dishwasher.  Question whether the end result is worth the effortBegin washing. Step 4: Transporting and Serving. <PIC> I was sharing my cake with friends, but not entertaining at home, so that cake had to travel.  No cake should sit out in the rain, and it was pouring.  I had a large Tupperware container but no lid (Did I see it out in the garage last week?).  The cake went in the container and was given a plastic bag topper.  Voila!  Cake condom.The cake arrived at its destination, safe from the elements and clouds of pet hair in my CR-V.  The confection was sliced up and served with aplomb and gurgled murmurs of appreciation from attendant teenagers and adults.  Go bake a cake and invite some company over.", "images_list": ["how-to-make-pumpkin-spice-cake-with-layers-and-fro_0", "how-to-make-pumpkin-spice-cake-with-layers-and-fro_1", "how-to-make-pumpkin-spice-cake-with-layers-and-fro_2", "how-to-make-pumpkin-spice-cake-with-layers-and-fro_3", "how-to-make-pumpkin-spice-cake-with-layers-and-fro_4"]}

Not true! The instructions tell you to use a quart of milk, to heat it to 180\u00ba, let it cool to 100\u00ba and add the starter. None of this is true - it is so much easier than that. I may have the temperatures wrong because I threw out the instructions long ago but you get the ideaFollowing the directions means heating the milk - which means getting out a pot, later washing that pot, it means using a thermometer, later washing that thermometer, it means standing around watching milk almost boil, then standing around watching milk get almost back to room temperature. It means finding a container to store the kefir in so it can go into the fridge after it gets thick, then later washing that container. Following the instructions is also twice as expensive as not following them - as you will see.

Step 4: Wait 24 Hours. <PIC> That's it, just wait 24 hours with the container sitting out of the fridge. After 24 hours you can test the consistency and see if it's as thick as you like, if not then give it a few more hours.

(I actually put it back on the stove on the very lowest setting for a couple minutes because my bacon and pasta didn't finish at the same time and I was afraid I didn't have enough heat to cook the eggs and cream properly.)*Be careful not to scramble the eggs by cooking it on too high a heat, that is why you take the pasta and bacon off the heat before adding the egg mixture.\n\t\tWhen everything is mixed up and heated up, stir in your peas and you are ready to eat. Step 4: Eat It!. <PIC> It is so good! \u00a0Eat it up!\n*Note for reheating. \u00a0It's hard. \u00a0You need to carefully heat it up like you would with candy melts. \u00a0Otherwise you start to scramble the eggs.", "images_list": ["homemade-carbonara_0", "homemade-carbonara_1", "homemade-carbonara_2", "homemade-carbonara_3", "homemade-carbonara_4"]}

{"id": "RECIPE_2270", "question": "What is the best way to press tofu for a delicious dish?", "provenance": [41463], "ground_truth": "Introduction: How to Press Tofu. <PIC> Tofu is one of my favorite foods to cook with. There are so many ways to cook it and it accepts flavors really well! I know that many people have issues with the texture of tofu, so I thought I'd show how I press my tofu to get the best texture from it. This really only works with medium, firm and extra-firm styles of tofu - anything softer and it'll just crumble under the weight!Plus, when you press tofu properly, you remove LOADS of water, which means there's more room for marinade and seasonings to get in and make your tofu awesome. :D Step 1: What You'll Need to Press Tofu at Home. <PIC> You can buy tofu presses (or make your own! We have a few tutorials here on Instructables), but they tend to be kinda expensive for how often I'd use them. Instead, I use these items:2 large plates2 paper towels or one cloth towela few canned foods or books, whatever you have on hand Step 2: Drain Your Tofu Over the Sink. <PIC> I like to use a knife to cut one edge of the package and let the tofu drain over the sink. You can slightly squeeze the package at this point too - it'll help get out a bit more water before pressing! I just press my palm into the top while I let it drain. Just don't press too hard, you can bust the tofu. :P Step 3: Set Up the Press. <PIC> Place the paper or cloth towel on a large plate in the middle. Make sure to fold it several times so there's quite a bit of bulk under the tofu. This is especially important if you're using paper towels - never do just one layer because it will disintegrate and attach itself to the tofu. Yuck! Place the tofu onto the towels, and then place another plate on top as shown. At this point, put 2-3 cans or a couple books on the top plate. This will create your press! Just make sure you don't add too much weight, because you can cause the tofu sides to break and collapse. Step 4: Press the Tofu for 15 Minutes to 1 Hour. <PIC> The longer you press it, the better it will be! I normally do mine for at least 20 minutes because I always seem to be rushing to cook, but an hour makes for amazing tofu as far as I'm concerned. I had enough time to let it sit for an hour today :DIf loads of water starts building up in the bottom plate, pour it off, otherwise just let it hang out. (See photo above for a gauge of how much water will come out!)If you're using cans you may need to slightly adjust their position or remove one depending on how the tofu is looking. Sometimes too much weight in one place can cause the tofu walls to bow out and break.  Step 5: Comparison of the Tofu Before and After. <PIC> This is what the tofu should look like at the end - it should be a bit smaller! If you pressed it for long enough, you won't see any excess water seeping from the sides, either. :D ", "images_list": ["how-to-press-tofu_0", "how-to-press-tofu_1", "how-to-press-tofu_2", "how-to-press-tofu_3", "how-to-press-tofu_4", "how-to-press-tofu_5"]}

The following is one of the easiest and tastiest  I have found.Nasturtium tropaeolum majus is a most useful plant to grow in any garden not just for decoration or wildlife habitat but because the leaves, flowers and seeds are all edible. They will also  grow in poor soil, in containers and as they can be found in both bush  and climbing varieties, are eminently suitable for urban or limited  space, square foot and vertical gardening.Here I am using them as an alternative to nori and making home-grown sushi wraps.TOP PHOTOGRAPHFor a more elaborate traditional sushi, I wrap the rice in extra large  nasturtium leaves. I don't have a rolling mat but just use eco baking  paper. I can then cut them into lengths just as I would with nori. You  can also use other leafy vegetables such as cabbage, kale or spinach but  the younger and more pliable leaves are easier to manage.SECOND AND THIRD PHOTOGRAPHSm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord - open sandwich style sushi. A very simple light lunch, created from balls of Thai rice just placed on nasturtium leaf wraps. I  married them with a confits de tomates and a fines herbes omelette. Just fold the leaf around the rice ball as you pick it up and bite into a taste sensation. Step 1: TIPS ON GROWING THIS MEDICAL AND CULINARY PLANT. <PIC> COMMON GARDEN NASTURTIUMS -  MEDICAL AND CULINARY TREASURE YET SO EASY TO GROWNative to South America, in the past nasturtiums along with sprouted seeds and citrus fruit were used to treat scurvy because of  their high  vitamin C content, they also contain valuable anti-oxidants.  Prized for  many centuries as a medicinal plant, the nasturtium can be used to   treat skin problems (in particular acne), hair loss, respiratory and  urinary infections. So there is a lot more to this common garden plant  than meets the eye! You can grow nasturtiums all year round in just about any soil and although they are often described as annuals they are in fact perennial, so if you are careful to place them near a stone wall or other heat sink, then you can keep them going through the Winter. Nevertheless, they do self-seed very freely so you can actually do as I do and let them continue in the container, just adding a little new home-made organic compost once a year or whenever you see the leaves beginning to lose their healthy green colour.The only pest problem they really seem to have here is attack by cabbage white butterfly caterpillars, who find them just as tasty as we do. They are however easy to pick off the leaves and as my quail love to eat them, are yet another bonus of growing nasturtiums.HAVE FUN!Just have fun experimenting with colour and their fabulous peppery taste will make you want to use them with all your favourite fillings. If you can try to get hold of some of the seeds of nasturtium Jewel of Africa - find them on seed swaps or you can buy them through good seed merchants, I get mine from Chiltern seeds, for example on-line. The leaves are most beautifully variegated and they make fabulous sushi wrapsPlease  feel free to ask questions or share your own ideas either here, or on  the article, or any other questions you may have about growing and  eating nasturtiums.The original article of mine can be found :hereAll the very best and Bon App\u00e9tit!Pavlovafowl aka Sue", "images_list": ["organic-seaweedless-sushi-making-your-own-home-gro_0", "organic-seaweedless-sushi-making-your-own-home-gro_1"]}

{"id": "RECIPE_2283", "question": "What\u2019s the best way to transform green coffee beans into a delicious cup of coffee?", "provenance": [41476], "ground_truth": "Introduction: Coffee From Bean to Cup. <PIC> This is my simple, relaxed approach to roasting, grinding, and brewing your own coffee. Coffee has been cultivated, traded, roasted, and brewed since around 1100AD, and as most of you remember from elementary History class, there was not electricity back then which means most of us possess the equipment or can cheaply acquire said equipment to do much of this ourselves. Most of us do not live in the right region of the world nor the right elevation to grow amazing coffee beans but once we can get our hands on them, the rest is a piece of cake.  I focused mostly on the roasting in this instructable hoping that if you are looking into roasting your own beans, you already have a pretty good grasp of the other two. Roasting really doesn't have to be that hard, it's really not that expensive, and to make your own fresh roasted beans to coffee is like no other coffee experience you'll ever have.  Step 1: Get Some Beans. <PIC> Green coffee beans can be found a lot easier than they use too. There's many different regions to get many different beans from that are good for many different things. Soil, altitude, ways of processing, size of bean, where in the world they are grown, all of these things effect the end product. If you are into flying that plane into the ground, there are hundreds of books and articles to read, this isn't that how to guide though. This is a very basic no frils, in case you are curious approach. If you like it and open your own roasting house, I expect some credit...  Personally I have really enjoyed getting my beans from a supplier called smokinbeans.com which also sell on Amazon. 1. Pick your bean. I recommend you start at the roast of coffee you like, then find what is the best bean for that roast. I like a medium roast so my favorite is  Yirgacheffe which is arguably one of the best beans in the world. (side note- great beans are much more affordable when they are still green so get something nice!)2. Buy your bean. Usually most distributers will sell in bags of 5 pounds or more but you can find less. Anything under 5 pounds though and for the price, usually, in my experience, it'll cost you the same as the 5 pound bag.  Step 2: Get Everything Else.. <PIC> 1. You will need one heat source. I bought a hot plate at Wal-Mart (I got the Oster Single Burner $19.99 only because it had the flat cook top and I didn't want beans falling through the coil of the $9.99 burner, it's up to you), it works just fine and it's very cheap. Get as fancy as you like, roast them on your grill, I've seen alcohol burners too... If you use a camp stove you might want to use a heavier pan than he aluminum popper just for heat transfer sake (but then you are getting into thermal dynamics and that's a different instructiable)   just have a little control of the heat and it can't get 1000 degrees F (of C for that matter) because beans do burn.2. You need a roasting container. I use a whirley pop popcorn popper ($19.99-$29.99 from your favorite online retailer). Again, it works great and again, you can get creative and use whatever you want. just keep the beans moving over the heat or once again, they will burn. (open fire or gas burner=thicker skillet and wooden spoon) 3. When they are done you will want a metal bowl, I like stainless, to cool the beans. A sink of ice water is nice but not absolutely necessary. A pair of work gloves I highly recommend so you don't singe off your finger tips while you're cooling the beans. And I recommend you do this all outdoors in a garage, back porch, fire pit camping, grill,  unless everyone in the house LOVES the smell of roasted coffee. You may say, \"But Chris, I have a stove, and a skillet, and a wooden spoon, what's stopping me from just roasting them right on the stove?\" The technical answer is nothing... Go for it! The only byproduct besides smoke and beans is something called chaff, it is the hull of the bean that get's burnt off, and it makes a mess while you are cooling the beans so, at least take them outside to cool them.Total investment:Burner $19.99Popper $25.99Beans, 5# $25.99The bowl and gloves I had...I bought a nice ceramic hand crank grinder for $35.00 on amazon but if you have a grinder you don't need this.That's it If you just had the cast iron skillet and the spoon and a fire, you can do it just fine... all you would need is the bowl gloves and beans, all the same concepts apply no matter the equipment... And with the crank grinder you can roast and brew completely off the grid! For all you survivalists out there :) Step 3: OK, the Meat and Potatoes, and Beans. <PIC> 1.Get hot plate, get popper, get roughly 10oz. of beans. Pour beans into popper. Don't put on heat quite yet... let's have a little talk.When I started doing this I read everything I could find, I started stop watches to make sure it was roasting right, I had my IR thermometers out to check the temp of the beans I was ALL OVER IT. I can tell you most of that has gone away. Turns out the beans do most of the work and they really don't need your help or encouragement. There are two defining stages in roasting that will help you know where your beans are at in the roasting process, first crack and second crack. First crack sounds kinda like pop corn popping and second crack is not as distinct, or quite as predictable. So if you are roasting anything but a City Roast+ like me, look up where in the cycle to take it. I'm sure someone that has brewed coffee for a long time is going to send me hate mail over this but  I pretty much always roast a city roast+ which is right after first crack-ish, So I roast until then and then I stop. And that's how complicated I choose to make it. Can you make it more complicated than that? sure... go for it. I know for a fact there are lots of other how to's out there that can help you with that. (OK truth be told I was going to just leave it at that but I started to feel guilty that I didn't include something else to guide you along a little better, then I remembered this link: (http://legacy.sweetmarias.com/library/content/using-sight-determine-degree-roast) If I'm going to keep it simple but not leave you stranded this is the site to fill the gaps! they have done a fantastic job of showing you how to tell your roast by site and have tons of more information if you desire a bit more information than what I provide along with being able to purchase a huge variety of beans. Ok so now, the basic name of the game is, (for my roast) get it to first crack quickly, then cool it down, also quickly...1.5. Beans in popper. (or skillet)2. Place on burner and turn that sucker up to high, if you are using what I use... (I'm shooting for about 450F for the beans in case you desire to use a blow torch, fire pit, camp stove, or engine block... try to adjust the distance from heat source to get roughly the same result as a stove to burner.) ((sorry I feel to reiterate so much right here but the \"high\" setting on your camp stove is not the same as the \"high\" setting on your stove top, or a fire, or whatnot, so before you end up with a pile of smoking black little dots in the bottom of your pan that are permanently burnt into place, make sure you kinda have the feel for the difference between boiling water and melting steel.)) 3. Start turning the handle and get comfortable. If you have the popper like I do, you'll be turning the handle for about 15 to 20 minutes straight so seriously, don't be bent over in some weird position. If you are stirring a skillet over a fire, make sure you aren't going to burn your hands over the coals for the next 15 minutes or try to hold a cast iron skillet by hand over a fire for 15 minutes. Hell try and do that for 2 minutes!3.5. It usually takes about 15 minutes or so to get them to where I like them, you'll have to experiment with your roast and beans to get what you want...4. Once they are where you want (mine are right after first crack) get them off the heat and put them in the bowl. 5. I toss them in the bowl to get as much air as I can between the beans while pretending to be the Swedish Chef form the Muppets to entertain my 5 year old. Bork Bork Bork... (a lot of you are to young for that reference I'm sure, you should look it up)5.5. Put the base of the bowl in the ice water to cool it down if it's getting to hot to hold, just don't get the beans wet. (you don't have to do this but it can save your fingers)Also you don't have to act like the Swedish Chef but I recommend it.  Step 4: Congrats! You Made Beans! Now Make Your Own COFFEE!. <PIC> 1.Ok your beans are cool to the touch, they may not be totally cool on the inside still so let the sit a while still before you grind them. (How long is a while? I have no clue, use your best judgment... If you REALLY want to grind them, a while will be a lot less time than if you are a very patient person I'm betting.)2.Grind them to Spec. I'm sure you know that different ways of brewing have different grinds but in case you didn't, they do. If you didn't know that, go find a website to explain this to you before you move forward. Or the owners manual to your coffee making apparatus...3. Brew and enjoy.-- You did it! --      Final thoughts: There is so much more that can be added and if you find you like doing this I encourage you continue to learn on the subject. Coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world only second to oil, and oil suck to drink... I also encourage you to look into purchasing fair trade coffee if you can or care. Basically all it does is make sure the farmer on the other end isn't getting ripped off by the government or market. It use to be a lot more expensive but now it's not that big of a difference. If you have any thoughts, helpful advice for the peeps, or ways I can make this better, leave me a comment or shoot me some mail.

I use chicken in my soup because I like the lemon-chicken flavor combo. If you were to try fish, I would recommend a white fish over a salmon. I steer away from using red meat in this soup because I don't immediately associate beef or pork with something very tart and sour.\nThis recipe, like so many of the ones I use, is flexible. I build my recipes mainly on feel, taste patterns, and smell. If things smell 'right' together, I use them together. That's how I decide on vegetables and spices. Sometimes I ask my mom what she puts in each recipe, and then if I know I can't get a certain item, I ask what my substitute options are.\nHere's what I've settled on my must-haves for Sinigang:\n\n\t\t1 pouch Tamarind Soup Base (Knorr brand), in 8 cups of water\n\t\tChicken breasts and thighs, cut into bite-sizes (you can use as much as can fit in your soup pot)\n\t\tDaikon Radish slices\n\t\tBaby Spinach\n\t\tAsian Green Beans (the long, thing kind if I can find it)\n\t\t1/2 or 1/4 White Onion (if I have it)\n\t\tLemon juice, and Lemon Pepper if I'm feeling spicy!\nThere's an order to putting the ingredients into the pot, just because things take a little longer to cook. First, you stir the Soup Base powder into the water, and set the stove to a high temperature. Next, add your sliced daikon radish, and green beans. I make sure to wash and peel my daikon before slicing, and snap my green beans into bite size pieces. I try to use chinese long green beans, but I can only get my hands on french green beans sometimes. The green beans make the soup smell a little awkward, my roommates say it smells like farts. Oh well!\nThen, you add your lemon juice and lemon pepper. Half a lemon squeezed into the soup works just fine. Next, chop up the onion and toss it on in. Let the soup get to a boil for about 5-10 minutes, chop up the chicken while you wait, and add the chicken when the daikon slices start to turn a little transparent. The very last thing you add is the spinach, so it doesn't overcook. Wait until the chicken is finished cooking in the broth, and then toss in several handfuls of spinach. Let those simmer for a minute or two, keep stirring, and then you are ready to serve!\nIf you have steamed Jasmine Rice, make some! I love to add a spoonful or two of rice to the bottom of my bowl before dishing up the Sinigang. It's just the way I always ate it growing up.

You know you have a loaf kicking around that's too old to eat, but not a moldy brick yet. There are lots of things to do with it actually and I won't insult your intelligence by listing them.

Step 1: Frozen Oldie. <PIC> Take your past-its-prime loaf and pack it away in a freezer for a day or two. Pull that sucker out get to work with a box grater.

Step 2: From Pale to Blond. <PIC> Those fresh grated bits looked like . . . I don't know . . . the chunky dust you have left over after doing some serious drywall work. To make this sad excuse for bread crumbs needed some help. I tossed it into a nonstick pan over high heat and tossed it until it was browned and lovely. I suppose you could do this on a sheet pan in the oven at about 400F degrees too. It took a while to do this because of the moisture of the bread crumbs. Ten minutes at most, but you had to drive away the moisture in the bread and the condensation that formed because it was so cold. Step 3: Store It. <PIC> I keep my bread crumbs in plastic bags or plastic containers. I also stash them in the back of the refrigerator. They keep practically forever.

Try it!And if you liked this instructable, please vote for it in the Vegan Food contest! Thanks!  Step 1: Make the Dashi Stock. <PIC> While traditional Dashi involves some element of fish in it, for our vegan version, we\u2019ll be invoking the Umami flavour through Kombu (kelp) and dried Shiitake Mushrooms. Here is your basic Vegan Dashi Stock \u2013 the base of oh-so-many things! Smells like death (not kidding!), but makes up with the umami flavour!You will need:- 2 dried Shiitake mushrooms, sliced- 2 'knots' of kombu (dried seaweed / kelp)- 1 1/2 c water, room temperatureMethod:- Soak Mushroom and Seaweed in water for half hour.- Transfer to a pan and simmer (do not boil!)- Strain and reserve the liquid. Discard the seaweed, but you may save the mushrooms as garnish for later.  Step 2: Make the Broth. <PIC> The Japanese say that a good Ramen is judged not by the noodles, but by the broth. There are so many kinds of Ramen broth \u2013 a clear soy base, tonkatsu (creamy pork broth), miso broth (fairly new to the Ramen culture) and more.The Vegan broth we\u2019ll be creating closely resembles the tonkatsu broth \u2013 no pork, but all the milky creaminess, thanks to soy milk. If you\u2019re not too particular about being Vegan, substitute with regular milk instead.Here are two ingredients that will make all the difference to your broth:Miso PasteThe biggest contributor of the classic \u2018umami\u2018 flavour in this dish. Find this at your local Asian supermarket. Most miso comes with bonito (fish flakes), so check ingredient list (then, check again!) to make sure there\u2019s nothing in there you can\u2019t eat.MirinA sweet rice wine commonly used in Japanese cuisine. Substitute with Sake, if you have some lying around.You will need:- 2 tsp. garlic flavoured oil (substitute with sesame oil / vegetable oil)- 2 inches of ginger, grated- 4 cloves of garlic, grated- 3 spring onions, chopped (white and green parts separated, sliced)- 4 tsp. red chilli paste (I used Sambal Oelek)- 3 tsp. white miso paste- 2 tbsp. mirin / sake- 2 tbsp. sesame seeds, powdered- 4 tsp. soy sauce (low-sodium)- 2 c soy milk- 1 c Dashi stock- White pepper powder, to taste- 1/4 tsp. salt- 1/4 tsp. fried red chilli flakesMethod:- Heat 2 tsp garlic oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Saut\u00e9 ginger, garlic and spring onion (white) for a few seconds.- Add chilli paste, miso, mirin, ground sesame seeds, soy sauce, soy milk and the prepared dashi stock. Season with salt, white pepper and fried red chilli flakes.- Once it begins to simmer (and most of the oil floats on top), remove from heat. Step 3: Cook the Noodles. <PIC> While the stock is simmering, put a large pot of water (salted) to the boil. Add two cakes of dried Ramen noodles and cook according to package instructions. Drain and divide the cooked noodles between two large bowls. Step 4: Assemble. <PIC> Divide the ramen broth between the two bowls. Garnish with your choice of toppings. Serve hot!Garnish options:- 1/2 c Fried Tofu (pressed and pan-fried)- 1/2 c sweet corn, cooked- 1 c bean sprouts, tossed in a pinch of fried red chilli flakes- 3 spring onion (green), sliced- 1 egg, soft boiled and cut in half (VEGANS, omit!)- 1/4 c fried garlic, crushed- 2 tsp. fried onions- 2 tsp. chilli oil- 1 jalapeno, sliced- 1/4 c onion, slicedThis  recipe was first published here.", "images_list": ["vegan-spicy-ramen-noodles_0", "vegan-spicy-ramen-noodles_1", "vegan-spicy-ramen-noodles_2", "vegan-spicy-ramen-noodles_3", "vegan-spicy-ramen-noodles_4"]}

It's simple. Because it's so easy to make I usually stick to small batches meant for a gathering. Simple syrup, especially spicy simple syrup, adds a great kick to your cocktails and mocktails. Jalapeno simple syrup is a particularly good addition to your strawberry margarita. Sugar is a great way to cut the heat of a hot pepper so you can taste more of the flavor and not feel like you're on fire.The uses for simple syrups are endless. They can go in your adult beverages, non-adult beverages (strawberry jalapeno lemonade, anyone?), in your baking or cooking. Add it to cupcake frosting or on top of ice cream,  the ideas are endless. I had hoped to do this Instructable with Ghost Peppers, but I couldn't find fresh ones anywhere. My local Whole Foods was able to put it on their order list, but recently informed me the peppers wouldn't be available until sometime in May.  Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> 1 cup of water1 cup of sugar1-3 hot peppers of your choice (jalapenos, habaneros, etc. are all good choices. I couldn't get my hands on fresh Ghost Peppers sadly).The 1:1 ratio will fill a small flip top bottle nearly to the top. The smaller Wreck container is 3/4 water to 3/4 sugar and has habaneros. *This recipe can be easily decreased or increased.  Step 2: Prep Peppers. <PIC> First and foremost, use gloves of some sort. It'll save you a lot of hassle later when you accidentally touch your face and don't have a burning sensation from the pepper oils. Wash and slice your peppers. The heat comes from the seeds and veins, so for a very mild syrup you want to remove the seeds and veins, for medium heat leave about half. You can always stick more seeds or peppers into your simple syrup after its cooked to infuse and get more heat. Also, it's super easy to make so make sure you write down how many peppers were used and whether or not it was too little or too much.  Step 3: Cook. <PIC> Mix the water and sugar in a pan and dissolve sugar over medium heat, let come to a boil. After boiling for a minute or so, lower the heat and add the peppers. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes. Stir occasionally, taste testing as you go.  Step 4: Strain and Bottle!. <PIC> When you are satisfied with the flavor and amount of heat, remove the syrup from the stove and pour into whatever container you plan to keep it in. I usually use small flip top bottles and a funnel. Allow to cool before putting the lid on. The cooked peppers can be used as a garnish, can be eaten as is, or saved for another recipe. Candied jalapenos are quite tasty. The syrup should stay good in an airtight container in the fridge for about 2 weeks.

A piece of brie, filling of your choice, enclosed in puff pastry shaped like pumpkins, topped with almonds, brushed with an orange-colored egg wash. When baked they puff up into mini pumpkins, crispy on the outside, gooey and cheesy on the inside, with a hint of sweet, or spicy, filling.\u00a0\nI used 3 different fillings that we all loved, hot pepper jelly, caramel apple cider jelly and pumpkin butter, feel free to use your favorite.\u00a0\nThese make wonderful appetizers, a great addition to your cheese plate, fun treats at a Halloween party, and, if you keep them sweet, a yummy dessert bite.\nI made two different sizes, you're only limited by the cookie cutters you have! One sheet of puff pastry yielded 6 larger bites and 10 one bite pumpkin puffs.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Step 1: Gather Ingredients. <PIC> You'll need:\n1/2 of a 17.3-ounce package Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Sheets (1 sheet), thawed according to package directions\nSmall amount of AP flour, for rolling out dough\nSmall wedge of Brie cheese (4 oz. is plenty), frozen for 20 minutes for easier cutting\n2-4 Tbsp. filling(s) of your choice (I used Hot Pepper Jelly, Caramel Apple Cider Jelly, and Pumpkin Butter)\n1 egg white plus 1 Tbsp. water, evenly divided in 2 small bowls (easiest to whisk first, then separate)\u00a0\nAlmond slivers, untoasted (to be exact, I used 44)\u00a0\nPastry brushes\nOrange food coloring, optional (I prefer gel paste)\nPumpkin shaped cookie cutters, I used one 1.5-inch diameter, and one 2.5-inch diameter.\nIf you want orange pumpkin puffs, color one bowl of egg wash as orange as you want it. For my puffs I used a small toothpick dipped in gel paste, blended with a fork it turned orange with very little gel paste needed.\u00a0 Step 2: Prepare Brie and Dough. <PIC> Adjust an oven rack to the middle of the oven and preheat oven to 375 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. I baked my two sizes on different sheets, but they ended up taking the same amount of time.\nYou have the option of removing the rind from your Brie, we enjoy ours without. Cut into 1/2-inch pieces for 2.5 inch diameter pumpkins, 1/4-inch pieces for 1.5-inch diameter pumpkins.\u00a0Place pieces on waxed, or parchment paper, and refrigerate while preparing dough.\nUnwrap and roll out dough, on a lightly floured surface, smoothing the creases into an even sheet.\u00a0\nCut as many pumpkin shapes as you can get, I made 10 small ones, 6 larger ones. Don't re-roll the scraps.\u00a0\nFlip over half of the pumpkins so when you flip them on the other half the shapes will match.\u00a0If at any point during the process the dough is getting too soft, place it in the fridge about 10 minutes to keep it chilled.\u00a0 Step 3: Fill and Seal. <PIC> For the small pumpkins use 1/4 tsp. filling, top with piece of Brie, brush inside rim of each pumpkin with plain egg wash.\u00a0\nFor the larger pumpkins use 1/2 tsp. filling, top with piece of Brie, brush inside rim of each pumpkin with plain egg wash.Because I like a good portion of filling, I usually topped each pumpkin half with filling, but one piece of cheese per pumpkin. Feel free to add the amount you prefer, just make sure not to overfill or you won't get a good seal.\nInvert pumpkin tops and press around all edges to seal.\u00a0 Step 4: Bake. <PIC> Move filled pumpkins to parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush with orange-colored egg wash.

Although it\u2019s been linked a great deal to Spanish cuisine, it\u2019s more popularly known in the Philippines and they have quite a number of variations of the dish to reinforce this claim. Ask any Filipino what their favorite viand is and expect that a large share of them will answer adobo. It may be a simple concoction of meat cooked in soy sauce and vinegar but the wonders it can do to your palate can be quite fascinating.Ingredients:\u2022 chicken, cut up into serving pieces \u2022 minced garlic \u2022 minced onion \u2022 dried laurel leaves \u2022 cooking oil \u2022 soy sauce \u2022 vinegar \u2022 black pepperInstructions: 1. Heat a pan in medium fire. While waiting, mince the garlic and the onion. 2. When the pan is hot enough, drizzle it with a bit of cooking oil. When the oil heats up, saut\u00e9 the garlic. When the garlic turns golden brown, toss in the onions. 3. Add the pieces of chicken and parboil them so that they absorb the flavors of the garlic and onion. 4. As the chicken simmers in the oil, add the laurel leaves. 5. Pour in the soy sauce and the vinegar. Adjust the amount depending on your desired taste. If you prefer your adobo to be salty, indulge on the soy sauce. But if you like it a little tangy, add a little more vinegar. 6. Once you\u2019re satisfied with the taste, cover the pan and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes. This will allow the meat to soak up on the flavors. 7. Check if the meat is cooked by poking it with a fork. When it\u2019s tender enough, it\u2019s time to turn off the fire. 8. Before serving, enhance its flavor by sprinkling ground pepper on the dish. If you\u2019re fairly new to cooking adobo, try out this basic method of whipping up this iconic dish.

Welcome to my second 'ible: an exceedingly healthy and incredibly tasty chicken and fennel bake.I struggle a bit with cooking as I have a condition that affects my short term memory so I can only cook when there is someone around to make sure I don't set the house alight. As my wife is out at work until late and rarely eats a proper lunch anything I do make needs to be ready fairly quickly. The beauty of this recipe is that it takes little time to prepare and cook but is really tasty. Serves two (with leftovers) taking ten minutes to prepare and around 30-40 minutes to bake at gas mark 6.  Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> Four chicken skinless thighs cut in half (much more tasty than other bits and healthier with skin removed) Two small fennel bulbs or one large cut in half or quartersTwo round courgettes (zucchini) quarteredTwo large carrots cut into sticksOne medium onion roughly slicedAs many garlic cloves as you dare (whole - you can leave the skin on) A pinch of chilli flakes (optional, though why wouldn't you?!) A large sprinkle of dried oregano (or any herb you fancy) Worcestershire sauceA tablespoon or two of vodka (optional) A few good glugs of extra virgin olive oil (I prefer Greek) Salt and pepper Step 2: The Really Really Hard Bit... . <PIC> OK, pay attention now. Place your chopped vegetables and chicken into a large oiled roasting tin. Sprinkle your herbs and seasoning all over. Splash over some olive oil, Worcestershire sauce and vodka (if you are using it). Dig in with your hands and smoosh those flavours together making sure that everything is covered. Cover with foil and place in the oven.  Step 3: Put Your Feet Up for a Bit, You've Earned It! . <PIC> Take thirty minutes to indulge yourself in a little of that remaining vodka.  Step 4: Dish Up. . <PIC> After 30 minutes check to see how it's doing. Give everything a good baste in the delicious gravy that you now have. Put it back in for another 5-10 minutes without the foil to get some nice little brown bits on the edges of the vegetables (for extra flavour). Serve up with your favourite side dish - mash, cous cous, risonne, roast potatoes. I've served up with brown rice to keep it extra healthy. Don't forget to spoon over some of the juices left in the pan. Bon appetite!

The best part is that the described man can make it himself! \u00a0Enjoy!

Plus there's no HFCS sneaking into your food.\nMeatballs*\n1 lb lean ground beef\n1 egg\n1/4 c Italian style breadcrumbs\n1 tsp garlic powder\n1 tsp onion powder\n1/2 tsp salt\n*Should make 12 - 18 meatballs depending on size. Mine are the size of a ping pong ball.\nLots of mozzarella cheese!\n1 baguette or 2 depends on how many you're feeding.\u00a0 Step 2: Sauce Was a Breeze to Make...... <PIC> Using a dutch oven pot, on medium heat, add oil, saut\u00e9 the garlic for about 30 seconds. Be careful, do not let the garlic burn or turn too brown because they will become bitter. Lower the heat if they start to turn brown too fast. Add the 3 cans of tomato sauce, basil, oregano and salt. Let it simmer on medium low. If it starts to bubble and splatter, lower the heat, it should be a gentle bubbling. Step 3: Shaping Balls. <PIC> Okay, now for the meat. In a good sized bowl add all of your meatball ingredients and start mixing with your hands. Make sure all of your ingredients are well blended. It should feel like play-doh. Start making little balls. I pinch off some meat, and start shaping it into a ball in my hands, making circular motions. Once all of your meat has turned into meatballs, carefully drop them into your bubbling sauce. By this time, the sauce is hot enough to start cooking your meatballs. I let this cook for at least half an hour, giving it a stir about every 10 minutes. After half an hour has passed, check a meatball. Pull one out with a slotted spoon and cut it in half. Is it pink? How's the flavor? Is it yummy? Step 4: Baguette Inlay & Broil. <PIC> You've waited the half hour and now \u00a0your meatballs are ready for baguette inlay. Slice your baguette lengthwise. You could butter up the bread and add some dried basil and garlic powder, if you want. I didn't this time because I was so freaking hungry. Dig a little bit of a well in your baguette to ensure that the meatballs won't roll off. Place your meatballs in the baguette and top with mozzarella cheese. Be generous too. Slide those bad boys under the broiler and pull them out once the cheese is golden bubbly and the bread is toasty perfect, about 2-5 minutes. Keep watching, do not walk away from the oven, not even to get the phone. I didn't listen to my own advice because I was watching t.v. \u00a0They were still delicious. \u00a0Prepare yourself for awesomeness!

The Bajji is usually called 'Chai Time Snack' which simply means 'Tea Time Snack'. There are may varieties of this tasty snack depending on what the filling is inside the batter.In this Instructable, I'll show you the recipe for an unusual type of bajjis, that is, the Bread Bajji. Yeah you read it right. This might sound weird, but it's the best way to reuse left over bread. Let's see how it's done.  Step 1: Ingredients. <PIC> For this unconventional recipe, you'll need the following ingredients:BreadGram FlourCorn FlourRed Chili PowderCumin SeedsSaltOilBaking Soda (Optional)That's all you need. So let's get started.  Step 2: The Batter. <PIC> The batter is a key part of the bajji, as this gives the taste and crispiness to the snack. The flavor and the color  of the bajji is totally dependent on the way the batter is prepared.First,  take in a bowl, 1/4 Cup Gram Flour, 2 Tablespoons of Corn Flour, 1  Tablespoons of red chili powder and the necessary quantity of salt. Now  add water into it and mix it well. To make the bajji more crispy, you  can optionally add a pinch of baking soda to it. Mix it well so that no lumps are formed in the batter and place it aside. Use your hands for mixing it better because using a spoon or something will sometimes leave behind lumps.  Step 3: Prep the Bread. <PIC> Once the batter is prepared, it's time to prepare the bread. The bread is gonna be dipped into the batter, so the choice of bread does matter here. If you're using soft bread, it might get soggy and break easily. So sandwich bread is preferred for the job. If you're using soft bread, then just microwave them for about 30 seconds so that they're hard enough.Now cut the bread slices into cubes or any shapes of your choice and keep them ready.  Step 4: Deep Fry Time. <PIC> Now that the bread and batter are ready, it's time to deep fry them. Heat some oil in a deep frying pan and while it's getting heated, coat the bread with the batter. Now carefully drop the pieces of bread into the heated oil. Fry it till it turns golden brown in color and remove it from the oil. Place it on some paper napkins to drain out all the excess oil from it.  Step 5: Serve Hot !!. <PIC> Now all you have to do is to transfer a few bajjis on to the serving plate and treat yourself with some tasty and crunchy bread bajjis. Serve it with some tomato ketchup as you can never go wrong with it. You can see that the crust is nice and crispy but the core is pretty soft and the combination of both is simply mind blowing !!Happy Snacking!! :P", "images_list": ["bread-bajji_0", "bread-bajji_1", "bread-bajji_2", "bread-bajji_3", "bread-bajji_4", "bread-bajji_5"]}
