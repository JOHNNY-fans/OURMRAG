{"question_id": "ARXIV_109", "dataset": "ARXIV", "type": "test", "question": "Why does the impact of the number of stages become more significant as the classification difficulty of the dataset increases?", "answer": "According to the experimental results shown in Figure 3, we observe that as the number of stages increases, the accuracy of the student model gradually improves on the MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. This effect becomes more pronounced as the classification difficulty of the dataset increases. The reason behind this phenomenon can be attributed to the model's need to learn more complex features.\nFirstly, as the classification difficulty of the dataset increases, the features that the model needs to learn become more complex. A single round of model training may not be sufficient to capture these intricate patterns and relationships. By increasing the number of training stages, the model has more opportunities to iteratively improve its predictive ability. This is especially true when the initial predictions of the student model are rough, and more stages allow for gradual refinement of these predictions.\nSecondly, the framework uses the predictions of the student model as prior knowledge, meaning that the output of the student model at each stage influences the learning process in the subsequent stages. As the training progresses, the predictions of the student model become more accurate, which increases the probability of outputting the correct label. Each stage not only allows the student model to improve its understanding of the data, but also enables it to receive more fine-grained guidance from the teacher model. This process helps the student model better adapt to more complex datasets, especially challenging ones like CIFAR10.<PIC>", "images_list": ["../ARXIV/2409_12384v1_2.png"], "ref_chunks": ["60055_3"], "image_find_chunks": ["60095_1", "60042_1", "60042_2"], "query_find_chunks": ["60055_3", "60053_2", "60069_3"], "image_find_scores": [0.2918681502342224, 0.2796834111213684, 0.27585142850875854], "query_find_scores": [0.6641968488693237, 0.5147859454154968, 0.497993528842926]}
{"question_id": "ARXIV_114", "dataset": "ARXIV", "type": "test", "question": "Why are existing self-correction methods difficult to implement in small language models?", "answer": "Existing self-correction methods are difficult to implement in small language models for several reasons.First, these methods rely on large-scale parameters and complex prompt engineering. In large language models, the self-correction process typically involves complex multi-step prompts and zero-shot prompt designs. This multi-step feedback and correction process requires the model to have strong reasoning and self-awareness abilities, which are typically achievable in large models. For smaller models, especially those with only a few billion parameters, they often struggle to process these complex prompts and feedback, unable to understand and accurately execute these steps.Second, small language models usually lack sufficient self-verification abilities. In large models, self-verification can be used to check whether the generated answer is correct and make necessary corrections. However, small models have limited self-awareness and are unable to effectively assess the quality of their own generated content, nor can they determine when corrections are needed. Due to this lack of self-awareness, these models tend to be overly confident in their generated results and do not recognize potential errors.Finally, existing self-correction methods depend on relatively complex multi-step pipelines and additional instructions to guide the model through the self-correction process, which is too complicated for small models. The understanding and reasoning capabilities of smaller models are limited, making it difficult for them to successfully execute these complex correction steps, resulting in poor performance on self-correction tasks.<PIC>", "images_list": ["../ARXIV/2401_07301v2_0.png"], "ref_chunks": ["60058_2"], "image_find_chunks": ["60024_2", "60092_1", "60024_1"], "query_find_chunks": ["60058_2", "60058_3", "60064_2"], "image_find_scores": [0.29289430379867554, 0.2788578271865845, 0.270537793636322], "query_find_scores": [0.673127293586731, 0.6108971834182739, 0.5396242141723633]}

With bananas. And cocoa. And coconut. Also a little spicy. Behold, the Spaghetti bananara. Yes, that is quite a stupid modification of 'carbonara'.First, you need to cook yourself some spaghetti. I used half hard wheat and half wholegrain. Throw them in boiling water with a little salt and a bit of butter. Boil for maybe 8min, until desired consistency, then strain.Then cut two bananas into slices. Put them on a pan. Add enough butter, shredded coconut, cocoa (I would have used pure cocoa powder, but only had instant cocoa drink powder, which also contains some sugar and tons of all the stuff they put in industrial food for no apparent reason) and ground cayenne/chilli pepper to taste. Add enough so you can feel it, why put it in otherwise? You don't need to add any sugar, the bananas are sweet enough for themselves.Start roasting this. Mix well, so the bananas are covered with butter, cocoa and coconut mixture.Roast and mix all the time. Bananas will soften and lose their shape, which is what we want.When there's something a little closer to a sauce than to sliced banana on your pan, pour it over your spaghetti like you would a regular sauce. You can top it with sour cream for example, but I had none, so I didn't.Now enjoy the genius of cooked bananas with the genius of spaghetti, all on one plate.I must say this idea was a little more on the \"awesome\" than on the \"stupid\" side.Substitute butter with coconut oil for vegan.Substitute wheat spaghetti with gluten-free pasta for gluten-free.Substitute cocoa drink powder with pure cocoa powder for sugar-free.Substitute flame with cool winter breeze for raw.Substitute spaghetti bananara with water for not hungry.I'll be happy to read your comments.If you liked these sweet spaghetti and/or my first instructable, you can also vote in the contest.

We then started with digging the marked area and then poured concrete in there. We then used concrete cinder blocks to build the walls. This was ultimately followed by tiling and grouting. All in all, it took about 3 weeks to finish, considering that we were only able to give this a few hours every day. Items needed: Sand Cement blocks (total number depends on how many and how high do you want the walls) Cement/concrete mix Tiles Mortar Grout A small counter grill, a large gas grill and a smoker Specifics: The digging was followed by mixing the concrete bags - we had to use about 35 of the 80lb bags. We waited for a few days to let the area completely dry. We then put concrete blocks according to the counter space we needed, and to make sure that the smoker and the gas grill fit as well. We also left some space between our back wall and the grill for safety reasons. We then filled up most of the blocks and spaces with cement. After it had dried well, we mixed up the mortar followed by tiling. Finally, we grouted the tiles, and left it for two days. Last thing was to add some style - we added some pebbles and gravel, and some decorations on top.", "images_list": ["../RECIPE/grilling-area-project_0.jpg"], "ref_chunks": ["40839_1"], "image_find_chunks": ["40839_1", "40393_1", "40621_1"], "query_find_chunks": ["40839_1", "40458_1", "40665_2"], "image_find_scores": [0.27385690808296204, 0.22011512517929077, 0.20296815037727356], "query_find_scores": [0.6926658749580383, 0.5710462927818298, 0.5171960592269897]}

Where I had access to fresh fruit, I made fruit concentrate (here's how). When there was pure, 100% juice available, I used the same instructable (the freezing method). The acai, I could only find in blended juices. However, Whole Foods sells a freeze-dried powder which I used instead.\n\t\tMix juice. The proportions I used: 1/4 cup each blueberry, pomegranate, and cranberry concentrates; 1 tablespoon acai.\n\t\tMake gummies according to my gummies Instructable. Pour them as small as possible into molds, or pour thinly into a rectangular pan and cut them apart into little chunks. Probably the chunk method works best- the ones I put in molds came out thin and wide, which made them difficult to embed in chocolates. Don't coat them in sugar or corn starch after removing them from molds.\n\t\tHeat dark chocolate in a double boiler. (About one bar of chocolate should cover enough candies to fill a Ziploc bag.)\n\t\tWhen chocolate is sufficiently melted, pour it into lightly greased molds(I recommend a mold for break-apart hard candy, the hexagonal mold shown) . Do not fill the molds completely! Do a little at a time (on my mold, a couple of rows at once), then press a chunk of powerberry gummy into the middle. Use your finger to pat some of the chocolate over the top to cover it. (This will be messy.)\n\t\tCool in the refrigerator for a short while, until chocolate is firm.\n\t\tCarefully remove from molds. Eat!

{"question_id": "RECIPE_1376", "dataset": "RECIPE", "type": "test", "question": "What are the essential steps to whip up a batch of delightful baked apple dumplings?", "answer": "Introduction: Baked Apple Dumplings:  Quick & Easy!. <PIC> Baked Apple Dumplings Stuff whole apples with a brown sugar mixture, and wrap with refrigerated pie crusts, to make delicious-looking baked apple dumplings that are relatively low on sugar, but high on flavor  -and quick and simple to prepare. This recipe is for 8 apples. Ingredients:    - 8 somewhat tart cooking apples, cored, but not peeled    - 1 (14 to 15 ounce) package of refrigerated pie crusts (packed two to a package)    - 1/2 cup light brown sugar    - 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon    - 1/3 cup chopped walnuts    - 1/3 cup raisins    - 1/3 cup oatmeal (rolled oats)    - 8 pats (4 Tablespoons) butter or margarine    - ~24 toothpicks Preparation:    1. Preheat oven to 400°F.    2. Mix brown sugar, walnuts, raisins, rolled oats, and cinnamon together, in a bowl.    3. Cut both pie crusts into quarters (= 8 pieces). Place 1 apple in center of each quarter-circle. Using a small spoon, fill apple cores with brown sugar mixture and tamp down as needed. It’s okay to let excess spill over onto the open pie crust.    4. Lift up the three corners of the pie crust, skillfully forming around the apple with your hands, inserting a toothpick into each corner of the pie crust. Insert toothpicks only halfway, as all of them will need to be carefully removed, prior to serving. The apples will only be partially covered by the ¼ pie crust, and will not at all look neat and tidy, but that will ultimately prove to give each finished apple a unique, rustic, and yummy appearance.    5. Arrange apples on a 13” x 9” cookie sheet, and top each apple with a pat (1/2 Tablespoon) of butter or margarine.    6. Bake at 400°F for 35 minutes, until the crusts are light to medium brown. Camping Option: Bake in a 14-inch diameter cast iron dutch oven. Arrange 40 red-hot charcoal briquettes in a circle on the lid, carefully positioned next to the raised edge of the rim, and 17 red-hot charcoal briquettes underneath, carefully arranged in a circle, positioned just under the round edge of the oven. Bake for about 35 minutes, checking occasionally. Boy Scout / Trail Life USA Option: Wrap each finished (cored, filled, and with a pat of butter top and bottom) apple with one layer of aluminum foil, shiny side out. Next, wrap again with another layer of aluminum foil, shiny side out. To produce an essential layer of trapped air between the two layers of aluminum foil, wrap the second layer of foil from the opposite side of the foil-wrapped apple, so that the wrinkled, thicker part of the foil wrapping surrounds the entire apple and prevents burned spots. Set the foil-wrapped apples over a bed of hot coals/charcoal, tumbling frequently with tongs, for about 20 to 30 minutes until done. \"Shiny side out\" foil wrapping will make the cooking more of an even-baked and controlled process.

{"question_id": "RECIPE_1293", "dataset": "RECIPE", "type": "test", "question": "What is the best way to prepare an indulgent spaghetti pie that features both Alfredo and marinara sauces?", "answer": "Introduction: Oh My Spaghetti Pie (an Old Chicago Copycat). <PIC> Oh my is the perfect description of this dish, because from the very first bite, you'll be saying \"Oh my\" until the last bite is gone! This pie is for my middle sister, she eats it at a favorite Denver restaurant, Old Chicago. We were talking about spaghetti pie a couple months ago and she sent me a picture of this and said she'd be thrilled if I could re-create the recipe for her. Looking at her picture I realized this was no \"normal\" spaghetti pie, this was MAGIC! Why magic? Because they make an ALFREDO spaghetti pie, and serve it on a bed of marinara sauce. Genius! I've loved Alfredo since I was a kid, buttery, creamy, cheesy, what's not to love? Calories, schmalories, sometimes you need to treat yourself! My dad loves a shrimp pasta dish where they mix marinara with Alfredo, so I knew he'd enjoy this too. My mom loved it as well, and I'm certain my vegetarian oldest sister will request it when she visits. The next time my sister and brother-in-law come home, I hope they can attest to its deliciousness, AFTER they help me make it! They definitely approved of the pictures, and my former-chef bro-in-law gave me some great advice on how to make it like they do in the restaurant. I searched other copycat versions, but those use jarred Alfredo, I'm OK with a lot of food in jars, Alfredo sauce is not one of them. A truly authentic Alfredo is butter and Parmesan, the version many make adds heavy cream. With salt and pepper that's 5 ingredients, not one jar of Alfredo sauce I looked at contains only 5 ingredients, so I'll go ahead and make my own, it's very easy, I promise. Even the Old Chicago menu reads: This Old Chicago exclusive starts with spaghetti tossed in Alfredo sauce made from scratch daily with Parmesan, mozzarella, Romano and provolone cheeses, topped with even more cheeses and slow-baked to toasty perfection. Served by the slice over our house marinara.  There are a few steps to this recipe, but they can all be done around, or at the same time, with a little multi-tasking. I will say you can use a good-quality jarred marinara, but the recipe I use, from Cook's Illustrated, can be made in less than an hour, and tastes as if it's been cooking all day.  I made a roux-based Alfredo, thick enough to coat the pasta and not separate when baked. Reserving a bit for a creamy top, made slightly gooey with a top layer of cheese. Some of the edges of the spaghetti get slightly crunchy (my favorite bits). With each bite you get rich creamy spaghetti Alfredo brightened up with the marinara. Some garlic bread and a side salad are all you need for a perfect meal.   My dad and I really love Arrabbiata, or zesty marinara, sauce, I believe you could use that as a base for some nice heat if you love spicy foods too.   Please enjoy this spaghetti pie as soon as possible so you can have an \"Oh my\" eating experience too!    Serves 8  Marinara recipe from Cook's Illustrated, March 2006 Step 1: Gather Ingredients. <PIC> You'll need: One 9 1/2- to 10-inch deep dish pie plate, sprayed with non-stick spray For the Alfredo pie: 1/4 cup unsalted butter 1/4 cup all purpose flour 2 cups whole milk 1 cup heavy cream Pinch ground nutmeg 2 cups Italian Five Cheese blend shredded cheese (I used Kraft Italian), divided 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided   Salt and pepper, to taste 12 oz. spaghetti For the marinara: 2 (28 ounce) cans whole tomatoes, packed in juice 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped fine (about 1 cup) 2 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons) 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano (since I forgot the basil, I used 1 teaspoon pasta seasoning mix instead of just oregano) 1/3 cup dry red wine (I used Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot would also work) 3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil (I unfortunately forgot to buy this)  1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil Salt and ground black pepper 1 - 2 teaspoons sugar, as needed  Step 2: Make Alfredo Sauce. <PIC> Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. (I also preheat a baking sheet on the rack, as I bake all my pies on baking sheets to contain any spills.)  Remove 1/2 cup shredded Italian five cheese from the bag, and add to a small bowl mixing it with 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan, set aside for topping the partially baked pie. You'll use the remaining 1 1/2 cups plus 1/2 cup Parmesan for the Alfredo sauce.  Combine heavy cream and milk in one measuring cup. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until foaming, whisk in flour until combined, continue whisking until mixture is smooth and slightly golden, about 1 minute. Gradually add milk and heavy cream, increase heat to medium-high and whisk constantly to combine into a smooth sauce. Bring mixture just to a boil, turn heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a pinch of nutmeg during this time.  Once sauce is thickened, start adding the cheese, a handful at a time, stirring after each addition waiting until the cheese is melted before adding more. Continue adding, and stirring, until the 2 cups of cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed, you may only need some pepper since the cheese is somewhat salty.  Turn heat off but leave pan on burner, cover, and keep warm until ready to toss with spaghetti.  Step 3: Make Marinara Sauce. <PIC> Cook pasta and begin baking pie while marinara cooks. Note: I actually halved this recipe, that was a mistake because it tasted so good with the pie, and garlic bread, we wished there was more.  Pour tomatoes and juice into strainer set over large bowl. Open tomatoes with hands and remove and discard fibrous cores; let tomatoes drain excess liquid, about 5 minutes. Remove 3/4 cup tomatoes from strainer and set aside. Reserve 2 1/2 cups tomato juice and discard remainder. Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden around edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes from strainer and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring every minute, until liquid has evaporated and tomatoes begin to stick to bottom of pan and brown fond forms around pan edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Add wine and cook until thick and syrupy, about 1 minute. Add reserved tomato juice and bring to simmer; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally and loosening browned bits, until sauce is thick, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer sauce to food processor (or transfer to saucepan and insert immersion blender; and add reserved tomatoes; process until slightly chunky, about eight 2-second pulses (you can make it as thick or as smooth as you like). Return sauce to skillet and add basil and extra-virgin olive oil and salt, pepper, and sugar (I added 1 tsp.) to taste. Step 4: Cook Pasta, Assemble, and Bake Spaghetti Pie. <PIC> As you start making the marinara, bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon salt then spaghetti, stirring occasionally to separate the strands. Cook until al dente (even slightly firmer than al dente since it will soften more as it bakes). I reserved 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water just in case I needed to thin the alfredo sauce (in the end I didn't, but save the water just in case). Drain the pasta and return to the pot. Stir the Alfredo sauce again to make sure it's smooth, then add all but 1 cup to the spaghetti and toss to combine. Return the cover to the Alfredo and keep it warm (my oven has a warming burner, if you don't, warm it gently over low heat before topping the partially baked pie with it.) If you feel the sauce is too thick and not coating all of the pasta easily you can add some of the pasta cooking water, a little at a time, until the sauce is thoroughly mixed with the pasta. Transfer the spaghetti to the pie dish and pat down the top to make an even layer. Bake for 20 minutes.  Step 5: Finish the Pie, Let Cool Slightly, and Serve With Marinara Sauce. <PIC> After 20 minutes, remove the pie from the oven. Re-stir the Alfredo sauce so it's once again smooth, top the pie with the remaining Alfredo using a spatula to spread over the entire pie.  Sprinkle the remaining 3/4 cup cheese on top of the Alfredo sauce, return to oven for 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and light golden brown. Rotate your baking sheet front to back halfway through baking. Remove from oven and let pie rest 10 minutes. Spread a layer of marinara sauce on each serving plate, or shallow bowl, cut pie into pieces and serve on top of marinara. (If I had some fresh basil I would've loved to sprinkle some finely chopped over the top of each dish.) Serve, garlic bread on the side is wonderful for scooping up excess sauce, enjoy!  Leftovers can be stored, covered, keeping the marinara separate, for 3 days. The pie itself reheats well in a toaster oven. I microwaved the marinara sauce while warming the pie. (I'm not sure if reheating the entire dish in the microwave would work well, the pasta might get too dry, but you could try it if you have leftovers and no toaster oven.)", "images_list": ["../RECIPE/oh-my-spaghetti-pie-an-old-chicago-copycat_0.jpg", "../RECIPE/oh-my-spaghetti-pie-an-old-chicago-copycat_1.jpg", "../RECIPE/oh-my-spaghetti-pie-an-old-chicago-copycat_2.jpg", "../RECIPE/oh-my-spaghetti-pie-an-old-chicago-copycat_3.jpg", "../RECIPE/oh-my-spaghetti-pie-an-old-chicago-copycat_4.jpg", "../RECIPE/oh-my-spaghetti-pie-an-old-chicago-copycat_5.jpg"], "ref_chunks": ["40832_1", "40832_2", "40832_3", "40832_4", "40832_5", "40832_6"], "image_find_chunks": ["40225_1", "41432_7", "40832_1"], "query_find_chunks": ["40832_6", "40832_2", "40832_3"], "image_find_scores": [0.2670632302761078, 0.265126496553421, 0.2573326528072357], "query_find_scores": [0.7416468858718872, 0.7415163516998291, 0.723725438117981]}

It was very experimental so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, and I was blown away by the results. It is THE CUPCAKE that has ruined all other cupcakes for me. I just don't think I can go back to paper-lined cupcakes AGAIN! Thank goodness I have an apple tree!\nYou will need:\n6 green apples\n1 spice cake mix (or your favorite recipe)\nFrosting (I ended up making carmel frosting)\n1. First prep your apples by removing any stickers & washing them.\n2. Mix up your cake batter as directed & set it aside\n3. Cut your apples in half\n4. Core them out using a large spoon & leaving about 1/4\" edge\n5. Place your hollowed out apple cups into a muffin pan\n6. Chop any salvageable chunks of apple up and throw them in the cake batter.\n7. Fill your newly made apple cups nearly to the top with batter. (You will have plenty leftover for whatever else you would like too)\n8. Bake as directed for your cake recipe until springy to the touch. (or toothpick method)\n9. Remove from the oven and let them sit about 5 minutes.\n10. Gently scoop them from the pan using a spoon or fork & transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely \n11. Once cooled whip up your favorite frosting and frost them. (Try some salted carmel frosting!)\nWhen I first took a bite of one of these I literally went weak in the knees. The cake stays so moist because of the juicies & there are multiple textures involved. I think the best part is that there are no pesky cupcake liners laying around everywhere because the entire cupcake is edible. I will say that the carmel frosting takes it to over the top deliciousness! Originally I was going to just use some store bought stuff, but the smell of spiced apples baking got me thinking of carmel. It complements the treat perfectly, you've got to try it. Here's the recipe I used. ( I did mix some of the store bought into mine too for kicks & giggles)\nSalted Carmel Frosting:\n1 C packed brown sugar\n1/2 C butter or margarine\n1/4 C milk\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1-1/2 to 2 C confectioners’ sugar\nSea salt\nCombine brown sugar, butter and milk in a saucepan; bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook and stir for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla. Cool to lukewarm.  Gradually beat in the confectioners’ sugar until\nfrosting reaches desired consistency.

{"question_id": "RECIPE_1516", "dataset": "RECIPE", "type": "test", "question": "What is your approach to making delicious biltong or jerky at home?", "answer": "Introduction: Making Biltong or Jerky. <PIC> Jerky is a great way to preserve meat in order to be eaten at a later date.  It makes a great treat, snack, or even part of a meal.  I like to make it in order to take with me when I go hiking or to be eaten as a snack as I drive home from work.  My method of making Jerky is a very simple.  It uses the basis of Biltong, which is an African dish that is preserved game meat.  I made a few changes to this traditional meal to make it into a jerky.Preserving food is a skill which has been  forgotten by many in our modern world. Learning and perfecting the   process of storing meat is a great skill for any person seeking   self-sufficiency. Whether you live in the country or in the city you   should be able to find space to practice making Biltong, gaining   confidence in knowing that you can store meat for later consumption.   Biltong is a method of curing strips of meat in order to preserve what   is available at a time of abundance, for use when meat is not available.   The type of meat extends to almost any animal, yet I normally use Beef   or game as for me it is so easily available. Step 1: What Will You Need to Make This?. <PIC> The process of making Biltong is not overly complicated, and the majority of the ingredients are inexpensive to purchase.Vinegar (I prefer Apple Cider as I find it adds great flavor)  Salt (preferably Himalayan Pink Salt, yet any salt will work in a pinch)  Ground Black Pepper  Ground Corriander Seeds  MeatThe ingredients are my own personal preference.  If you can't find the Pink salt, go with which ever salt you can find (although I would recommend against a rock type salt.  It requires more salt to work, so your food will be very salty).In addition, many types of meat can be used, some people have had great success with  Fish, Chicken and Game meats. I usually stick to Beef, yet  I know that  Kangaroo Biltong is also very tasty. The above list of  ingredients is  just the basic requirements. It is not uncommon for  personal taste to  play a factor in the ingredients. Chilli, Garlic,  Brown Sugar and  Worcestershire sauce do make for some great  modifications to the recipe.  I will leave it to you to consider your  own tastes and modify  accordingly. Step 2: Slicing the Meat. <PIC> Traditionally the meat is cut into strips of around an inch (2.5 cm) in  width, making a rectangular prism (or box) shape. I have found that I  get much more enjoyment from the biltong when it is cut thinner, perhaps  around 25/64 of an inch (1cm). The length of the strip is only limited  to the location you intend to dry the meat. I use a meat dryer that I  built, so the strip is limited to 9 inches (20 cm). I prefer to remove  all fat from the meat while I am preparing the cuts. The fat won’t spoil  the biltong, yet in my opinion it can make the taste of the meat less  palatable (or waxy) and can also make it tougher.Once the meat is sliced into the appropriate dimensions it is placed  into a large bowl and soaked in the vinegar. It is recommended that you  allow between 12 to 24 hours for the meat to marinate in this liquid,  yet I have had no problems with as little time as one minute in the  vinegar. The vinegar will add flavour to the meat and, more importantly,  will create an acidic environment that will almost eliminate any chance  of botulism. Once you are satisfied with the marinating it is time to  add the spices.aten it  all. Step 3: Spicing the Meat. <PIC> To prevent wastage and to ensure a proper coating, it is wise to add each ingredient individually. I place the meat on to a work area (for  example, a chopping board). I usually start with salt, taking a pinch of  salt and evenly spreading over each side of the meat. I have tried  several types of salt in this step and I have had the best results with  Himalayan Pink Salt. It is very subtle and does a great job of drying  the meat without adding too much saltiness. You can easily add too much  salt here, so I find the less the better. One pinch of salt can be used  for an entire slice of meat.Once I am satisfied that the meat is very lightly coated, I sprinkle on a  dash of black pepper and a liberal coating of ground coriander seeds.  It is at this stage you could add your other spices.Once you have coated the meat you are ready to set them aside in a  refrigerator to start the process of drying. In more simpler times you  would have set the meat out to dry and hope the insects could not find  them. Now you can leave the meat in your fridge (preferable sitting on a  cooling rack which is placed over a tray to catch the fluids, yet that  isn’t too important) to begin the drying process far from the attentions  of curious flies. I have been told that flies will not land on the  drying biltong due to the faint aroma of vinegar and the black pepper… I  do not believe it. I have seen flies land on many things much more  disgusting than drying meat so I do not believe they are too finicky to  try some of the biltong.If you own a meat dehydrator you could follow the unit’s instructions to  dry the meat, yet I prefer to use more simple solutions. This is to  either use my custom built, passive meat drier, or to hang the meat on  strings which I have placed in a shaded area. I would recommend that you  place the meat inside (at least for the first few days) if you are not  using an enclosed container so that insects are not attracted to your  work.It is important that the meat be placed out of direct sunlight, as well  as in a location which has easy access to fresh air. I prefer to do this  in the summer, so that I am guaranteed to get a gentle warm breeze  which helps to dry the meat. To hang the meat I use paper clips, which I  have modified by bending them slighting and skewering the meat at the  thicker end before hanging the meat to dry.After a couple of days you can, if you can’t wait, try the biltong. It  normally takes around 5-7 days for my biltong to be dried to a stage  which I like (as dry as cardboard). I would recommend trying it daily  till the meat has reached a stage which you are satisfied. When the  Biltong is ready, remove it from the hangers and store. It can be vacuum  packed for longevity, yet I find that it stores fine in a mason jar. I,  however, don’t normally worry too much about storage… it tastes so good  that it rarely lasts more than a couple of weeks before I have eaten it  all.", "images_list": ["../RECIPE/making-biltong-or-jerky_0.jpg", "../RECIPE/making-biltong-or-jerky_1.jpg", "../RECIPE/making-biltong-or-jerky_2.jpg", "../RECIPE/making-biltong-or-jerky_3.jpg"], "ref_chunks": ["40970_1", "40970_2", "40970_3", "40970_4"], "image_find_chunks": ["40970_4", "40970_1", "40970_3"], "query_find_chunks": ["40970_1", "40970_2", "40970_3"], "image_find_scores": [0.33953559398651123, 0.272268682718277, 0.25297972559928894], "query_find_scores": [0.7553473711013794, 0.653007447719574, 0.6342859268188477]}

If you can use basic kitchen tools, you can make these beautiful desserts!To begin, you'll need the following supplies:4 red apples (red delicious have a beautiful skin for this project, but any red apple will do)1 lemon (or 2-4 tbsp of lemon juice)Apricot preservesFrozen pastry puff dough (like Pillsbury)CinnamonYou'll also need the following tools:A large microwave-safe bowlA sharp knifeA small bowlA microwaveA muffin tin Step 1: Prepare the Apples. Begin by cutting the apples into VERY thin slices. If you have a mandoline, that can be helpful, but not necessary. You want your apple slices to be 1/8 of an inch or less - the thinner they are, the easier it is to roll them up later!After cutting your apples, place them in a large, microwave safe bowl. Add warm water to just cover the apples, and add the lemon juice to the water. Swish the mixture around to mix the lemon juice in (this keeps the apples from browning).Microwave the apples for 3 minutes on high. This will soften the apples to make them workable. Afterwards, drain the water from the bowl. Step 2: Prepare Your \"glue\". The apricot preserves are going to help hold your apples in place. In order to make the preserves easier to work with, combine 3 tbsp apricot preserves with 2 tbsp of water. Mix gently, then microwave for 1 minute and stir. It should be a thin consistency that's easily spreadable. Step 3: Prepare the Dough Strips. <PIC> Unfold the sheet of pastry dough.

On each strip, spread some of the apricot preserve mixture in a thin coat along the entire length of the strip.Place apple slices along one edge of the strip of dough, with the curved edge hanging over the long edge . You should overlap the apple slices with each other. Sprinkle the apples with cinnamon.Fold the empty side of the dough long-ways over the apple slices. Starting at one end of the strip, roll the dough into a spiral (like rolling up a sleeping bag).Place the newly formed rose in a muffin tin.Repeat for each of the 11 other strips of dough.

{"question_id": "RECIPE_1552", "dataset": "RECIPE", "type": "test", "question": "What is the best way to prepare delicious carnitas tacos for a fun gathering?", "answer": "Introduction: Impossibly Easy Carnitas Tacos. <PIC> Let's have a taco party!  I'm going to show you how to make pretty much fool-proof carnitas tacos. They're impossibly easy to make, and they're perfect for a casual party, an outdoor picnic, or even while you're out car camping. You'll be the hit of the party, and it's not even hard to do.  A note for purists: This isn't the definitive way to make carnitas tacos. In fact, it's kind of cheating because I use a crock pot instead of roasting a big piece of pork for many hours in the oven. It's also not as fatty as true, authentic carnitas, which traditionally uses lard. Yep, the hard stuff. I prefer doing it this way. It's no doubt much healthier.  One more thing: This recipe is perfect for a party in the park. I've set up a camp stove with a cast iron pan on top on a picnic table and cooked carnitas tacos to order for both kids' soccer parties and adult boozefests.  Wait... one more thing. I STRONGLY recommend using a cast iron pan for this. Otherwise, you won't get crispy carnitas.  What you'll need to make 15-20 modest-sized tacos 3 pounds of country style pork ribs, blade roast, or pork butt 1 jalapeno pepper 1 anaheim chili or other pepper of your choice (optional) 3-4 cloves of garlic 1 large white onion 1 bunch cilantro 4-5 limes or lemons (I happened to have lemons but prefer limes) Salsa of your choice  A big pack of small corn tortillas  A large cast iron pan Optional ingredients  Cumin, oregano, onion powder to season meat before cooking Radishes for garnish Step 1: Crack Open Your Crock Pot. <PIC> First, get out your crock pot and toss your pork into it. Chop up your peppers, taking care to remove the seeds. Peel and roughly chop your garlic and toss it in the pot, too. If you have it, throw in 1/2 Tbsp each of cumin, oregano, and onion powder. The dry ingredients are optional, but if you have them I would recommend using them.  Turn your crock pot on low and cook for 8-10 hours. I usually cook the meat the day before I actually want to eat carnitas tacos and just put it in the fridge once it has cooled. You'll see that this is not a problem and may even be preferable.  Step 2: Prep, Shred, and Cook. <PIC> \n          When you're ready to cook your tacos, get yourself prepared so you can bang them out quickly. You want two things here: 1) a hot cast iron skillet that will retain heat and 2) partially shredded pork. Carefully break up your pork. It will already be falling aprt from the crock pot cooking, but since it's been sitting in the fridge all night, you can still keep some large pieces intact. Don't shred your pork too finely because you want some chunks of meat. Mmmm. Meat.   Heat up your cast iron pan while you:    Dice your white onion     Chop up your cilantro     Stack up some tortillas  The actual cooking is easy. In your hot skillet (gas on high for a few minutes prior) pour 4-6 Tbsp. vegetable oil into your skillet. Using tongs, fill the bottom of your pan with a layer of partially shredded pork. Don't stir. Turn your heat down to medium and let it cook for a few minutes. Then, rearrange the meat so that you can crisp up the parts that aren't crisp. After a few minutes more, you should start heating up your tortillas, preferably in another pan or on an open flame.  Step 3: Plate and Try Not to Eat Too Many!. <PIC> The great thing about cooking these in a big cast-iron pan is that you can push crisped up meat to one side and add more meat as you go — serving from one side of the pan while replenishing crock-pot pork from the other. Cast iron holds its heat, so you won't need to worry about adjusting the temperature. Just stick to medium after you get going.  It's important that you get some decent crispiness, so it's okay if the meat stays in the pan. It may dry out, but you will be adding salsa and citrus when serving, so don't worry too much about that.  To serve, heat two tortillas per taco and lay them on a plate on top of each other. Place some carnitas on the tortillas, sprinkle with white onions and cilantro, and slap a spoon of top-notch salsa on each taco. Garnish with quartered radishes and lime or lemon slices.  Repeat until everyone is happy. ", "images_list": ["../RECIPE/impossibly-easy-carnitas-tacos_0.jpg", "../RECIPE/impossibly-easy-carnitas-tacos_1.jpg", "../RECIPE/impossibly-easy-carnitas-tacos_2.jpg", "../RECIPE/impossibly-easy-carnitas-tacos_3.jpg"], "ref_chunks": ["40991_1", "40991_2", "40991_3", "40991_4"], "image_find_chunks": ["40991_1", "40991_4", "40991_3"], "query_find_chunks": ["40991_1", "40991_3", "40991_2"], "image_find_scores": [0.30107641220092773, 0.2845674157142639, 0.23998893797397614], "query_find_scores": [0.7288378477096558, 0.6885557174682617, 0.6634448766708374]}

It seemed my only real option (in my opinion) was to give fried green tomatoes a go. I’d never made them and it just made sense.Southern dishes are always such a curious undertaking. Rich, fatty, flavourful and full of character, dishes such as red-velvet cake, deep fried chicken, fatback collard greens and pecan pie are typical staples of southern cuisine. As a Yank, I live vicariously through my Southern friends and the feeling they get about their comfort foods. Wikipedia told me that the most notable influences of Southern cuisine come from the English, Scottish, Irish, German, French, Native American and African American traditions. I enjoy taking moments to step back and savor the history of this melting pot cuisine before diving into my own version. Here are my fried green tomatoes. Step 1: Ingredients and Directions. <PIC> Tangy Fried Green TomatoesIngredients 6-7 medium sized firm, green tomatoes 1 cup of cornmeal ½ cup all-purpose flour 2 tsp salt 1 tsp garlic powder ½ tsp cayenne pepper ½ tsp paprika 1 tsp dried basil 1 tsp black pepper 2 eggs ¼ cup milk or buttermilk 1 lemon Cooking oil Directions Slice tomatoes into ½ inch slices. I do not recommend using end pieces as they don’t hold the cornmeal mixture very well, so be sure to make each slice flat on both sides. In a small bowl, mix the eggs, milk and lemon juice as well as some of the zest. Combine all the dry seasoning, flour and cornmeal into a container with a top (or one that is deep enough so you can shake the contents without making a mess). Heat a skillet or frying pan in medium high heat. Add enough oil to grease the pan with a (not too) generous layer. Begin dipping slices of tomato one at a time into the egg mixture. Then drop them into the cornmeal mixture. Cover the container and shake for a few seconds. Your tomato should be thoroughly coated in cornmeal. Place coated slices in the hot pan and fry until golden brown on each side. This could about 5 minutes per side depending on the heat your stove produces. When cooked to your satisfaction, place the slices on paper towels in order to soak up some of the grease. Dip in hot sauce and devour while hot.

If you've been following my blog, you know by now that I dabble a little bit in making my own recipes, but mostly try others recipes. And a few day ago Jenny Flake, from Picky-Palate, asked if I would be interested in posting one of my own recipes as a guest post. First, total excitement hit, followed by panic. I want to start making more of my own recipes, but that hasn't been a huge priority since there are so many recipes I've been wanting to try. So, yesterday was crunch time. Time to make an amazing recipe that would wow everyone. No pressure.\nAnd for all of those who haven't tried to make a recipe, just know it's not horribly easy. Isn't not greatly difficult ether. It just takes a good amount of creativity, but there is a lot more that goes into it then just going by someone else's recipe. A lot of trial and error. Plus after figuring out your ingredients and how to make whatever it is you are making, you have to compose directions to go with your ingredients, and this all needed to get done quickly so I could get back to Jenny and let her know if I even had a recipe I wanted to feature on her blog. Needless to say, it was a long day. Above is the aftermath of nonstop cooking.\nBut, can I just express for a second how hugely excited I am about this recipe. While trying to figure out what it was I wanted to create, it hit me that I've been wanting to feature a Monkey Bread recipe for a while, and it's fall, so the thought pumpkin something kept rolling around in my head. So put the two together and you have Pumpkin Spice Caramel Pecan Monkey Bread. After playing around for a while, it was finally time for the final taste test. Apprehensively I took a bite... My first thought was, \"Wow!! It turned out amazing. Yay!!\" But then I was like, \"After all this hard work, I'm bias.\" so I need someone else's opinion who is just as picky as me. My mom!! I'm not gonna lie, I was even more nerves to have her try my concoction then I was to try it, but she loved it too. She thinks I should submit it for a recipe contest, but we'll figure that out at a later time. But for now, not to toot my own horn, but this recipe is 100% amazing!! Hope you like it!

{"question_id": "RECIPE_1788", "dataset": "RECIPE", "type": "test", "question": "What’s the process for creating custom chocolate shapes using a chocolate gun and a vacuum forming machine?", "answer": "Introduction: Chocolate Gun and a Vacuum Forming Machine. Vacuum forming is easy and fun!!!Lets make some cool chocolate moulds!Check out the video first =) Step 1: Let's Make a Box!. <PIC> To make a chocolate mould we need to assemble a vacuum forming table. Vacuum sheet forming is the simplest and least expensive of all thermoforming processes. A sheet of hot plastic is is blown in to a bubble and then sucked onto the surface of the form.A vacuum forming table basically is a simple box with some holes on top to create a suction area. To make this box I’m using:A sheet of 2x2 feet MDF, 1/4” thickness and two poplar boards 1”x3”x2feet.As a reference for my table dimensions I used a letter size sheet of paper. I used a 45 degree miter joint to create my box, but you can use any joinery method for your box. As long as you have straight corners you will be fine.Cut your top and bottom panels to the size of your frame. The top panel will be our suction area, so we need to make some holes there. I marked a grid to drill my holes so they are approximately an inch apart from each other.After I drilled all my holes (including a hole on the side of the frame for my vacuum connection) I attached my panels to the frame with some drywall screws.The box is done. Step 2: Making a Mould. <PIC> From the same piece of MDF I made a frame to hold up the plastic sheet. I've attached the plastic sheet to it with binder clips. The more binder clips the better the edges of the form will hold the shape.But before we put plastic in the oven, we need to create a razed support for our frame there, so we have space for hot plastic to stretch down. I put 4 ceramic bowls in the oven to create a support for each corner of the frame.For plastic I'm using a food safe PET plastic, 0.5mm thick . Preheat your oven to a 350F. Don't forget to use oven mittens then you working with hot stuff. Put your frame with mounted plastic sheet on it  in the oven for about a minute or two. Get the frame out of the oven as soon as the plastic sags 2-3 inches below the frame level. Put it over the running suction table. And in seconds the plastic magically will be shaped around your object.It takes some practice, and depending on your plastic you will need to play with the heat settings. Step 3: Chocolate Time!. <PIC> Melt some chocolate chips or baking chocolate in a double boiler. Pour it in the mould and put it in the fridge to cool down. Super easy!Now you know how to make an awesome custom chocolate. You can use different objects to create the form. It would make a great present or a sweet treat for yourself. =) Step 4: Enjoy!.

In this instructable, I will show you how to make Corn Tortillas with three ingredients and gluten free. A full instruction and downloadable recipe can be found on The Tortilla Channel.The tortilla is the base of the Mexican kitchen but also an egg dish in the Spanish kitchen. I have found that just about any culture has it’s own tortilla. That is why you can’t go wrong with a “tortilla”.I always used store bought tortillas thinking it would be either to difficult or take to much time to make them from scratch. Until I found how easy it is to make my own corn tortillas.  Ok they may not look the same as store bought ones or taste the same (they taste better in my opinion). The best part is you can use them as a base for other recipes think tacos or tortilla chips. Step 1: What Do You Need to Make This Recipe. <PIC> For corn tortillas you have to use special corn flour which is called Masa Harina. You should not confuse it with polenta flour or cornstarch. Masa Harina can be white or yellow. I bought the white variety but the yellow is even nicer with the happy color. As soon as you open the packet you smell taco making preparing even better. I found the flower online and it is also available in several varieties at Amazon.com.Besides the right flour it is also important to have a tortilla press or use a rolling pin. Put some plastic between the press and remove the dough as soon as you press else it can be more difficult to get them out. Either lay them apart or press just before you put the tortilla in a hot pan. Step 2: Instructions. <PIC> Put the 2 cups of Masa Harina in a bowl.  Add the salt to the bowl and stir thoroughly. Add 1 cup of hot water and stir again with a wooden spoon before adding the additional half cup of hot water.  Knead the dough into a consistent ball. Cover with a towel. Rest the dough for 1 hour. Create balls the size of a golf bal. Heat a large pan. Cover the tortilla press with plastic and press the tortilla. Cook the tortilla on medium to high heat for about 1 minute until the tortillas get some color. Turn and heat the other side of the tortilla for also 1 minute.  Store in a tortilla warmer or keep in a cloth. Step 3: Notes. <PIC> Make sure the water is hot to properly activate the Masa Harina.  I use a non stick pan to cook the tortillas without any oil or butter. You can store the torillas in a ziplock plastic bag in the refrigerator for about 1 week or in the freezer. You can heat them in a pan or in the microwave using a ziplock bag or cloth to cover them. Step 4: Watch the One Minute Video.

There is a tiny battle being waged to determine which is superior: creamy or crunchy. I fall pretty squarely in the crunchy congregation. I know that I am not the only member of the cult of mac and cheese who prefers that cheese to have been slightly burnt. (And to those of you with me in the choir, we'll feast on crunchy bits after I wrap up this cheesy sermon for the runny-lovin' unbelievers.)With this recipe, I'm looking to convert creamy mac and cheese lovers into disciples of something crunchier, edgier, and more delicious.\nIf you have only ever gummed down delicate arpeggios of creamy layers of cheese in perfect al dente pasta*, the bite from the sharp cheddar and the staccato crunch of baked macaroni will be a bit of a shock. You'll be disoriented at first. Frightened. Perhaps awestruck in the pants-pooping tradition of many a prophet in the face of the sublime. Be not afraid. \nThis is my grandmother's recipe. There are four ingredients: elbow macaroni, sharp cheddar cheese, butter, and dry mustard. Bake at 375 for half an hour. Increase heat or time for added crunch.

It was for That Takes The Cake 2011 in Austin, TX. I've onyl been making cakes since August 2010 and this is still just a hobby for me until I get the funds to get everything I need to start up a business and I'm self-taught so I'm super happy that I even placed in the top 10 at the show. I came in 8th!\nI had a lot of issues and mistakes but I learned a lot and am now planning and starting my next sculpted cake for a show at the end of April.\nThe theme for the Showcake category at That Takes The Cake was Super Heroes and Villains from comics, books, movies and TV. I chose to make Hellboy because I love Mike Mignola's work, as well as the movies and loved Ron Perlmann as Hellboy.\nDepending on your artistic skill, this could be hard or easy. Towards the end of this cake I didn't get as many photos, as I was behind on time, but I hope this Instructable can at least give you the basics on how to make this!\nThe head and arms are rice cereal treats and the rest is Devil's Food cake (felt that was fitting for Hellboy) covered in fondant and then detailed and hand painted with gel food colors. One of my mistakes was hand painting the skin and base. I hadn't yet learned to use the airbrush I recently bought and was out of time so I hand painted it and it came out really splotchy, with brush marks and was way too wet and shiny for way too long. I would definitely recommend using an airbrush! Although the texture was great for the coat.\nI also didn't build up the shoulders and I should have, as once the heavy fondant was on they shrunk in. Also didn't use enough support dowels and separators inbetween every few layers so his body started to settle and compress down with the weight of the cake (this is the biggest cake I've ever made, learned a lot!) but his head and top of shoulders were made out of the rice cereal treats and stayed up on the supports, so he eventually came apart, starting even before judging. The 4 hour drive to the show I think hurried the process along.\nHere's a list of general supplies I used to make the cake:\n• Cake pans for baking the cakes. I used a quarter sheet pan for all of the cake.\n• General cake decorating supplies: Mixer, spatulas, turn-table, carving/clay/fondant/gumpaste tools, matt to roll fondant on, fondant rolling pin, gel food colors, knife, cake leveler, toothpicks, food-safe paintbrushes, small containers to mix food color \"paints\" in, tape, cake support dowels, etc.\n• Ingredients to make cakes, buttercream icing, fondant and to mix food colors with (you will mix the food colorings with something like vodka or clear vanilla extract, not water.)\nI had to make a wooden base to support such a heavy cake so I've shown that in this Instructable too. I used two 24\" x 24\" x 1/2\" plywood pieces, and a larger wooden dowel and wood screw and then a pack of wooden cabinet knobs as the feet, so that it would be easier to get fingers under the heavy cake and board.\nHere's the link to the alterations made to a box cake mix to make it a little stronger to better support sculpting. I altered this recipe a little, adding an extra egg and an extra half cup of flour.\nhttp://cakecentral.com/recipes/7445/the-original-wasc-cake-recipe\nHere's the link to how to make the marshmallow fondant, which is pretty yummy, although very sweet! Pre-made fondant can be bought if you do not want to make the marshmallow fondant but beware that some of the pre-made doesn't taste very appetizing. Two brands that do taste good are Satin Ice and Fondx. I've used the Wilton once before and it's not too great tasting.\nhttp://www.wilton.com/forums/messageview.cfm?catid=7&threadid=137541&FTVAR_MSGDBTABLE=\nHere's a simple recipe for the buttercream icing, a 2 lb batch. This uses shortening in place of butter. I'm in Texas and butter doesn't hold up as well. If you don't have a stand mixer or don't want to make your own icing you can buy some pre-made.\nIngredients:\n2 Cups Shortening\n2 lb bag Powdered Cane Sugar (or approx. 8 Cups)\n4 TBSP Meringue Powder\n2 tsp Vanilla Extract (use clear vanilla if you want your icing to be white)\n2 tsp Butter Flavor (use clear flavor if you want your icing to be white)\n1 tsp Almond Extract\nWater\nDirections:\nSift together powdered sugar and meringue powder into large bowl. Set aside.\nMix the flavor extracts together in a measuring cup. Add enough water to the mixture to bring the amount to 1/2 a cup. Put this into a mixer bowl with the shortening.\nAdd about 1/4th of the sifted powdered sugar/meringue powder mixture to the shortening and flavors in the mixer bowl. Beat on a slow speed with the paddle beater and the slowly incorporate the rest of the powdered sugar mix into the mixer bowl as it's slowly mixing. Once it's all in there I usually turn it up a notch in speed for about 1 1/2 - 2 minutes. Then it's done!\nKeep it covered until you are ready to use it, as it will \"crust\" over if you are not ready to use it and leave it uncovered to the air. Step 1: Making the Base. <PIC> To make the base to support such a heavy cake, I used two pieces of 24\" x 24\" x 1\" plywood. I rounded off the edges of both boards, rounding the front edges more. The display table at the show was rounds so I wanted the base to be rounded off. I then glued them together with wood glue and nailed them together.\nYou can see an extra strip I added on the back egde. That was to be for some elements that I had to omit due to time constraints so that can be ignored. :)\nOnce it was together, I sanded it all down. Then I drilled a hole in the center where I wanted my main support dowel to be, the same size as the wood screw shaft, but smaller than the screw head. For this support dowel I chose a 1/2\" dowel, 24\" long since the minimum height for the competition was 24\". I made a small hole in one end with a small drill bit. Then I pushed my wood screw through the hole in the base from the bottom and screwed on the support dowel.\nOnce done I added some plain wooden cabinet knobs I found at Walmart that came in a pack of ten. I drilled small holes in the base where I wanted the feet to be and then attached them with wood screws. Step 2: Covering the Base With Fondant. <PIC> Next I made a large batch of the fondant and covered the base with it.\nAfter making the fondant and setting it aside, all wrapped up so it wouldn't dry out, I brushed on a layer of piping gel to the top of the base and sides and about an inch over the edge on the bottom. This gives something for the fondant to stick to.\nI rolled out the fondant and layered it on the base in several pieces, as I couldn't roll a big enough piece to cover the whole thing in one piece. This was OK though since I was going to cover over the seams where the pieces met.\nAfter this was done I rolled out the rest of the fondant and cut random tapering, curving strips and layered them on top of the fondant covered base, radiating out from the center support, mostly in front. These fondant pieces were \"glued\" to the fondant on the base by brushing some water on the backs of them before putting them down on the base. Step 3: Stacking and Carving the Cakes. <PIC> Before I stacked the cakes on the base, I covered the base with plastic wrap, leaving a rectangle of space around the dowel uncovered, so that I could apply icing there before stacking the cakes so that they would stick to the base. The reason I covered the base is so that when I was carving the cake, covering it with icing and fondant, the fondant bas wouldn't get messed up by cake crumbs and icing.\nI stacked the cakes, with buttercream in between the cakes. Every 4 cakes I would insert smaller dowels, cut to the same height of the top of the top layer cake, then cut down a carboard cake board, cover it with wrap, and place it on top of the doweled cake, to help support it. I should have done this better, and with every two cakes instead of every four, and used slightly bigger and thicker cardboard. Perhaps using hot glue to glue a few cardboard cake boards together. Still learning about cake support and this was definitely a learning experience!\nI ended up using 10 quarter sheet cakes. I also was trying to use up all the leftover icing I had made from my cake decorating class so that's why it's multi-colored. :)\nNext I shaped the stacked cakes a little with a knife. I had tons of Hellboy reference photos printed out and layed on the counters so I could look at them easily. Step 4: Shaping and Adding the Head and Arms. <PIC> Next I made a triple batch of rice cereal treats, using the recipe on the Rice Krispies box (also on their website) and used them to shape his head and arms.\nDidn't get photos of this process as while doing it my hands were lightly coated with Crisco so that the treats wouldn't stick to my hands and I didn't have time to keep stopping and washing off my hands to take photos. :( I was running behind!\nI formed the pieces around the smaller cake dowels, with parts of the dowels sticking out so I could push them in to the cake when attaching them.\nAgain I had photos all around me while doing this for easy reference. Step 5: Covering the Cake With Icing & Fondant. <PIC> Next I covered the cake and cereal treat with buttercream icing. That gives the fondant something to stick too and helps get smoother coverage, a little \"padding.\"\nAfter covering with icing I rolled out fondant to start covering. Again, here's where the Instructable kind of ends, as by this time I was way behind and needed to finish so we could make the 4 hour drive to the show.\nI covered it in pieces. Working \"background to foreground.\"\nFirst I covered all the showing skin areas and head (minus the sideburns and the horns) and sculpted and detailed them along the way before they dried out too much. I had made hollows for the eyes and after it was covered added the eyeball and eyelids separately.\nNext I did the pants, then belt and horseshoe and rosary.\nNext was the lower portion of the coat, then the sleeves, then the upper portion of the coat.\nLast was to add the ears, the sideburns of the hair and horns.\nI used gumpaste/fondant tools for all the detail.\nAfter it was finished I painted it with Wilton food colors mixed with vodka. you can use either vodka, clear vanilla or other clear flavor extracts, or other clear alcohol to mix the colors with. Water makes fondant gummy and too much will ruin it so you want to use water as glue and alcohol to paint with, as it will evaporate, leaving behind the color and not ruining the fondant.\nAfter the show was over I kept the base, to reuse, and the head since it was rice cereal treats. I took some better photos of the head after I got home. Still splotchy but dry at least!", "images_list": ["../RECIPE/how-to-make-a-sculpted-hellboy-cake_0.jpg", "../RECIPE/how-to-make-a-sculpted-hellboy-cake_1.jpg", "../RECIPE/how-to-make-a-sculpted-hellboy-cake_2.jpg", "../RECIPE/how-to-make-a-sculpted-hellboy-cake_3.jpg", "../RECIPE/how-to-make-a-sculpted-hellboy-cake_4.jpg", "../RECIPE/how-to-make-a-sculpted-hellboy-cake_5.jpg"], "ref_chunks": ["41007_1", "41007_2", "41007_3", "41007_4", "41007_5", "41007_6"], "image_find_chunks": ["41007_1", "41007_6", "41007_5"], "query_find_chunks": ["41007_1", "41007_5", "41007_2"], "image_find_scores": [0.3163067102432251, 0.31266799569129944, 0.2842259407043457], "query_find_scores": [0.7114673852920532, 0.6891274452209473, 0.6809991598129272]}

{"question_id": "RECIPE_1958", "dataset": "RECIPE", "type": "test", "question": "What’s the best way to prepare delicious Royal Ruby Shortbread Cookies that are both sweet and chewy?", "answer": "Introduction: Royal Ruby Shortbread Cookies. <PIC> These cookies are the perfect balance of sweet, salty, and chewy. Every time I make these, people ask for the recipe, they are that good. They are easy to make and prep days in advance to make even faster. These cookies are so versatile, you can add any kind of jam or filling of your choice, Nutella, chocolate ganache, lemon curd, almond filling...the list goes on and on. That's what makes these cookies so fabulous, the fact that you can customize the flavor profiles to however you like!Enjoy eating! Step 1: Royal Ruby Shortbread Cookies. Begin with the cranberry - orange jam so it has a chance to thicken and cool down for the cookiesStart by adding cranberries, water, and sugar to a saucepan and stir so that all the sugar has been hydrated.Put on medium heat until the cranberries start to leech out water...Then carefully transfer mixture to a blender or food processor.Blend until the mixture is completely smooth, skins and all...Return mixture back to saucepan and continue to cook for 15 to 20 mins on medium heat...The jam should coat a wooden spoon without dripping comepletely off.Once the jam is done cooking add the zest of one orange, mix and then transfer into bowl and set in fridge.Then continue on to making the shortbread dough...Start by creaming sugar, salt, and butter in mixer or a bowl if using a hand mixer.Once creamy and smooth add vanilla and mix.Then add flour and mix on slow to prevent flour from going everywhere.Once the shortbread is done, wrap it up with plastic wrap and set in fridge for 45 mins to hour to get it cold and ready to roll out...Once ready to roll...Preheat oven to 350After the dough is chilled...Take dough out of fridge and flour counter surface that you are rolling the dough onto...Don't forget to flour the top of the dough and the rolling pin tooRoll dough out to about 1/4 in...You want to work a little fast because once the dough is warm, it is harder to work with and sticks to pin and counter... If the dough starts to become warm, no worries just transfer onto sheet tray and put back in fridge for 20 mins or so until dough is cold again...Once you have the dough rolled out take a biscuit cutter or round cookie cutter about 3 inches in diameter and cut out rounds out of dough...You can use scrap dough, just remember to smoosh all scrap pieces back together and put back in the fridge to get cold again...Once you have your rounds, pull out your jam and in the center of each round put about 2 teaspoons of jam...Once the jam is in place...Take a bowl and add one egg with a dash of water in it and mix with fork tto make egg wash...this is used as the glue to hold to triangle cookie shape...Brush egg wash with pastry brush circling around the jam on the dough on each round...Once egg was is on, pinch the sides of the round into threes to get that traditional triangle shape, should pinch 3 times on each round to make 3 corners to create the triangle...I like to cook these cookies on parchment paper, easy clean up... also the parchment helps prevent the bottom from over browning... And then you don't need to grease the sheet tray either!Set in oven at 350 for 12 to 15 mins ( until the corners are slightly golden browned) Once done take out and transfer onto a cooling rack...If you want to make these cookies even prettier, dust a little bit of powdered sugar on top for a more finished look!You can also make these cookies with raspberry, or strawberry... Just swap out the berries for the jam recipe.These cookies are so easy to make, and look extremely impressive. You can prep in advance by making jam and dough days before hand. You can alway make dough in advance ( even freeze dough) just remember if you plan on using frozen dough take it out of the freezer a day before making and set in fridge to thaw.Jam you can make up to a week in advance, just remember to put in air tight container to prevent any other flavors from the fridge seeping in...These cookies are such a delight, you will have all your family and friends asking for the recipe... Not to mention they make a very affordable gift!", "images_list": ["../RECIPE/royal-ruby-shortbread-cookies_0.jpg"], "ref_chunks": ["41234_1"], "image_find_chunks": ["40730_1", "40183_5", "40464_1"], "query_find_chunks": ["41234_1", "40142_3", "40056_3"], "image_find_scores": [0.24654699862003326, 0.22912639379501343, 0.22383412718772888], "query_find_scores": [0.7891100645065308, 0.5826618671417236, 0.5787873268127441]}

{"question_id": "RECIPE_2053", "dataset": "RECIPE", "type": "test", "question": "What is the overall process for crafting a delicious mead from honey and water?", "answer": "Introduction: Mead Making. <PIC> Mead!\nAn ancient beverage created through the fermentation of honey and water.\nThis simple Instructable is meant to help guide the beginner mead maker and is not intended to be a full discussion of the biochemistry, though I may provide a more thorough run down in a future piece. Mead has a lot of variants, so in order to keep things fairly simple, I've chosen to start off with a Metheglin, which is a mead that contains some herbs and spices. If you want to make a traditional sack mead or quick mead, omit the herbs and spices. \nThe ingredients in the Image 1 are all you'll need to make a fine mead. Equipment is not pictured here are: purified water, a sampling cylinder, pH strips, hydrometer, a clean mesh splatter guard, funnels, boiling vessels, bung locks, tubing, airlock, primary and secondary fermenters. You should also get yourself a Vinebrite filter. Starting Out: \n1. Clean all your equipment thoroughly. This will require more than simply running it through the dishwasher. I recommend acquiring some OneStep or Starsan to make sure you've really done a good job sterilizing your equipment. (The old microbiology adage is that there is no such thing as a little sterile. Since you are not working in a Class 100 bioproduction suite, the cleaner you can be, the better.) \n2. Ensure you have sufficient starting materials. Write out your recipe in your notebook. Nothing is more frustrating than having to run back out to the store when you're knee deep in this recipe. \n3. Safety. A good apron and a set of kitchen mitts and gloves are vital to this recipe. Hot honey is not fun to spill on yourself or others. Ingredients: \nEverything is ratios for this kind of work, which is nice because you can scale you recipe up and down more easily if you base everything on volume of the batch.\nYou will want to end up with a specific gravity of 1.09 (Image 2) to start the primary fermentation if you want your mead to have a punch to it. This works out to about 2.5-3 lbs of honey per gallon (1.1-1.4 kg/3.8 L). Make it a little heavier if you want sweeter and alcoholic meads, and a little lighter if you like it to be a bit more balanced. \nYou want to have a good amount of acid starting out in the primary fermenter. You'll accomplish this by juicing a few oranges and a couple lemons into the water when you set the honey on to heat. To improve the flavor of the mead and it's mouth feel, you can zest the lemon and the oranges into the batch. Check the pH on your final must to make sure you are in the pH 3.5-4 range (Image 3). If you need to go lower, add a bit of acid blend or lemon juice. \nFor the chemical additives, I recommend following the directions on the the yeast nutrient and the grape tannin to ensure you've used enough of them. Boil\nAn important note on honey is that you don't have to boil it to sterilize it. Wild yeast can be killed in 22 minutes at 147 F (64F). The more important need to boil the honey is to facilitate the removal of the dissolved wax inherent in most commercially available honey. If you don't remove this wax the yeast may have a difficult time maintaining itself in solution and will agglutinate and fall to the bottom of the fermenter. While the honey water mixture is heating, it will begin to form a foam on the top of the solution. Use the clean splatter guard to remove this foam (Image 4). Once the foam is removed, you can add your cloves, vanilla bean, cardamon, and cinnamon to the batch. Pour\nUse the funnel to pour the hot (Not boiling) mixture into your clean fermenter. Once the material cools to ~ 65-75F (18-24C) it can be innoculated with the yeast. Take a sample of the primary fermenter, put in your yeast (number of packets depends on your total volume). Allow 15-60 minutes for this sample to begin fermenting. Innoculate the fermenter with the yeast mixture and stir the vessel. Once innoculated, the fermentation will be vigorous for the first 6-12 days. You will want to have a closure that allows for a lot of gas to escape, but prevents things like insects (Fruit-flies!) to gain access to the mixture. (Image 5 contains a blow off tube system. A tube is attached to a valved spigot which runs from the top of the fermenter to a jug full of water. The tube is placed down into the water. This allows gas to escape but nothing can enter the fermenter.) Be sure to leave some headspace in your fermenter or you will probably get some overflow as you volume will increase a bit as the yeast begin to release carbon dioxide. Secondary and Tertiary Fermentation: \nAfter the inital fermentation, the amount of bubbling should have lessened or even subsided. It's time to \"rack\" the fermetation into an airlocked vessel (Preferably glass, steel, lexan, or PETG). The primary simply needs to be put through a large strainer and into the secondary (Image 6). (You can add some vitamin C, ascorbic acid, to this to reduce the impacts of oxidation. Further you can use a liquid handling peristaltic pump or a siphon and run the solution down the side of the secondary fermenter.) Whatever your method, it is vitally important to be very clean during the racking. Once the solution is transferred, you can put your air lock onto the secondary and put the mead in a dark place where the temperature is stable. In 1-2 months, you should check your mead and rack it again (off the lees, which are the precipitated yeast and waste materials of the fermentation.) Each successive racking should go through finer and finer filter materials until it can pass through a vinebrite filter. Once it can go through this filter you are ready for bottling.\nYou'll know your mead is ready as it will be crystal clear, the amount of bubbles in the solution will be minimal and it will have a strong alcohol content. This will be evidenced by \"legs\" in your wine glass and by taking a sample of the batch and comparing the hydrometer reading to the original reading. The fermenter solution should read 1.00 at the end of fermentation. Kegging/Bottling\nMead can be stored in barrels like a wine or a whiskey, it can also be bottled and corked in Wine Bottles. (You can even wax the tops of the bottles if you like, Image 7). Mead ages very well as long as it is kept out of the light and in a cool dry place. The average amount of time that I age my mead for is between 3-6 months. I always kick myself for not aging it to the longer end of that range (Image 8). Good luck and enjoy mead making! ", "images_list": ["../RECIPE/mead-making_0.jpg"], "ref_chunks": ["41302_1"], "image_find_chunks": ["40973_6", "40973_4", "41302_1"], "query_find_chunks": ["41302_1", "40203_2", "40503_4"], "image_find_scores": [0.29651525616645813, 0.2844237983226776, 0.27132171392440796], "query_find_scores": [0.744268536567688, 0.5749912261962891, 0.5637946128845215]}

If you want to successfully compete with steak & beer, then you need to bring out the big guns: donuts, bacon and whiskey!Ingredients:Donuts:\ndonut recipe adapted from secretdonutrecipe.com\n2 cups flour\n1/2 cup warm mashed potato\n1/2 tsp kosher salt\n1/4 cup sugar\n1 cup warm milk (not hot) \npinch of sugar\n5 tsp. yeast\nCanola Oil for frying + 2 tbsp\n1 cup milk\npinch of sugarCandied Bacon\n1/2 cup golden brown sugar\n1/2 to 1 tsp. Cayenne pepper\n8-10 Bacon SlicesWhiskey Glaze\ninspired by Saveur magazine's Maple glaze- I left out the maple syrup & added whiskey\nTo taste- 3-5 tbsp high quality whiskey\n2 cups confectioners sugar\n1/4 cup heavy cream\npinch of kosher salt\n5 tbsp. WhiskeyMake the Dough:\nTo make the donuts, start by gathering all the ingredients. The donut recipe suggests baking the potato in the microwave, but I boiled mine. Either way will work. Clean and peel your potato. Bake in the microwave for five minutes or boil for 10-15 or until tender. Mash the potato. You will need 1/2 cup for this recipe. \nNext, you need to make a milk mixture by warming 1 cup of milk in the microwave for a few seconds or on the stove. You want the milk to be slightly warm. Not hot. Once the milk mixture is warm, remove it from the heat and stir in 5 tsp. of yeast and a pinch of sugar. Stir and let the mixture sit for 5 minutes until it bubbles. \nNext, in a kitchen add mixer bowl,  combine the flour, sugar, salt & potato. Next, add the milk mixture and 2 tbsp. of Canola oil. Using the paddle attachment, knead the dough for three minutes. The dough was really sticky, so I added a few extra tbsp. of flour as needed.  You can also do this step by hand. Remove the paddle attachment and cover with saran wrap. Place a cool damp cloth over the top allow the dough to rise for at least an hour. Make the Candied Bacon:\nPre-heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine 1/2 cup of brown sugar with 1/2- to 1 tsp. pf cayenne in a large bowl. Stir the mixture until no sugar clumps remain. One bacon strip at a time, press one side of the bacon into the mixture and coat it. Place it on a  baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Repeat with the remaining bacon strips. Bake for 8-12 minutes or until the bacon is crispy or done to your likeness. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Cut the bacon into bit size pieces. Back to the Donuts: Once the dough has risen, punch it down and lightly flour your work surface & rolling pin. Roll the dough out and use a donut cutter or glass to cut out the circles. Allow the dough to rise again while you heat up the oil. \nIn a deep cast iron skillet, pour in the canola oil. You don't need to put in too much. Just enough to cover the donuts. The oil should be about 360 degrees. You can do a test run with the donut holes. \nPlace the donuts in the oil, three at a time. Flip the donuts over after 8-12 seconds and allow the donut to get golden brown. Remove the donuts with a heat safe spatula and place on a rack to cool. Make the Whiskey Glaze:\nCombine whiskey, confectioners sugar, heavy cream & salt in a bowl. Whisk until smooth. Glaze the donuts:\nDip the donuts face down into the glaze and using a circular motion with your wrist, coat the donut. Top immediately with the candied bacon sprinkles. \ncheers!", "images_list": ["../RECIPE/man-bait-whiskey-bacon-donuts_0.jpg"], "ref_chunks": ["41367_1"], "image_find_chunks": ["41367_1", "41186_1", "40106_1"], "query_find_chunks": ["41367_1", "40665_1", "40774_1"], "image_find_scores": [0.34339284896850586, 0.2626986503601074, 0.26107901334762573], "query_find_scores": [0.7293463349342346, 0.614887535572052, 0.5900452136993408]}

Yummy, I assure you that! I made my bread not so sweet because I saw recipes on the internet that were stuffed with lots of sugar. I didn’t want that! :) So, I made this stunning & very appetizing pumpkin bread! This is great & tasty enjoyed with the same ginger, cinnamon & cardamom tea in your tea mug!  Check it out for yourself, my lovely ones! ;)Recipe: For 1 pumpkin bread, about 9 thicker slices Ingredients:** The dry ingredients: 1 cup organic light organic spelt flour 1 cup organic wholemeal spelt flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon garam masala ( my garam masala mix has also cardamom in it ) 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, I did it in my pestle & mortar ** The wet ingredients:1 cup + 1/2 cup mashed roasted pumpkin. /I used freezed roasted pumpkin from last year/ I placed it into my microwave to defrost. It defrosted in 8 minutes. Mix through with a spoon & take 1 cup + 1/2 cup. 1 tablespoon canola oil 1/2 cup maple syrup 1 teaspoon vanilla extract/ I use home-made 1 flax egg = to substitute 1 egg/ Grind your 1 tablespoon flaxseed into your grinder & measure out 1 tablespoon. Take this + mix this in a bowl with 3 tablespoons water. Mix with a fork & wait for about 10 minutes until it forms a sort of gel. Now, you can use it. ** The rest: 1 cup yellow dried raisins Step 1: . <PIC> 1. First, soak your yellow raisins in a tea for 30 minutes. I used Pukka-tea : organic cinnamon, ginger & cardamom tea.   Pukka tea: Revitalise! Organic tea with cardamom, ginger & cinnamon!I made my tea by steeping my teabag for 6 minutes into my tea mug. I placed my yellow dried raisins into a medium bowl. I used250 ml tea. I poured the tea onto my yellow dried raisins & let them soak for 30 minutes, to absorb the lovely flavours of my delicious tea so that would be juicy & bigger! After 30 minutes, drain the tea liquid. Place the juicy raisins into a sieve to shake the sieve up & down a bit to shake of any excess of liquid. Step 2: . Preheat your oven to 180°C ( 350 F ) for 10 minutes. I always use a fan oven. Adjust your oven to the right temperature.In a Kenwood-bowl or a big bowl, sift the light spelt flour, add the wholemeal spelt flour & sieve the baking soda, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, garam masala & the cloves. Mix lightly with a spoon, carefully not to mess with the air! ;), until well combined. In another large bowl, add the wet ingredients. Add pumpkin purée, flax egg, canola oil, maple syrup & vanilla extract. Mix well with a medium whisk.Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients & mix with the K-paddle or mix it by hand or with an electric whisk until all beautifully combined! Spoon with a spatula, everything round & check that you have incorporated everything into your Kenwood bowl. Mix again. Now, add the drained yellow raisins to the batter. Mix on low-speed for a minute or less, or until well mixed into the batter. Step 3: . <PIC> Take your oven rack & place a Silpat for stability. Take your silicon bread pan & you don”t have to grease it because it is silicon. It won’t stick afterwards! Fill it until all of your batter is gone. Smooth the top evenly. Place into the preheated oven on the lower rack of your oven & bake for about 50 minutes or until a pin you put into it, comes out clean. I baked my bread on 180°C ( 350 F ) for 40 minutes & lowered my oven onto 165°C ( 329 F ) for about 10 minutes. See that the top of your bread won’t get burned!!! I tested my bread in 3 places & the pin came out clean. Test it into the thickest part 2 times & into the side part, 1 time. Now, remove from the oven & place onto a wire rack for 10 minutes. Than, remove the silicon tin & place onto the wire rack to cool down completely. Store in a cookie or cake tin.Serve with a loved one & drink the same tea with it that you used into your beautiful cake aka bread! This is great on its own or smeared with some vegan butter! ;) MMM! A great breakfast too. 2 slices will really fill you up! It goes a long way!

{"question_id": "RECIPE_2167", "dataset": "RECIPE", "type": "test", "question": "What are the essential steps to prepare a delicious espresso coffee at home?", "answer": "Introduction: Espresso Coffee. <PIC> Tired of spending $3 every morning for your espresso coffee half decaf, low fat, extra foam latte? I was, although I was in between machines as my 10 year old espresso machine died and it took me a while to figure out my upgrade path. My wife speculates that I did about 12 hours of research into finding the perfect espresso machine to buy. I also spent a couple of months testing out the various morning coffee locations and was getting embarrassed by what was coming out of my mouth when I ordered what I thought was a simple drink, but was hard work spitting out without any caffeine.I'll walk you through the basics of espresso coffee and my personal favorite espresso+steamed milk variation, the latte. I will share my hard earned research and tell you the best espresso machine to buy and how I came to that conclusion. Why make your own espresso?For me the main reason was that I couldn't order exactly what I wanted. I needed more control over the amount of caffeine and the espresso to milk/foam ratio.The experience and benefits of making something yourself, no matter how small or trivial, is also something I crave. Starting off the day crafting my drink of choice makes my day that much better.So let's get started. Step 1: Espresso Machines. <PIC> Before getting started on your path to espresso perfection, you're going to need to decide what kind of espresso machine you want to buy. How much should you spend?Let's do the math. My wife and I typically have one latte a day, so at $3, that's $2,190 a year. I expect a quality espresso machine to last at least 10 years and probably more if it's properly maintained. I probably would have spent up to $2-3k if I thought the machine was worth it. I ended up spending about $1,200 for the espresso machine and grinder.There are too many espresso machines to choose from and it's hard to figure out which is the best one. I stayed away from the pod only machines, since I wanted to have control over where I bought my coffee and what kind of coffee I wanted to use. For example the Nespresso machines don't have an option to buy a half decaf pod and each pod costs $.50. Most of these machines won't do much for steaming milk either. I don't like twist off beer caps or screw-off wine caps, so where's the art is throwing in a pod and pressing a button. Not for me thanks.The best espresso machine for your moneyThrough my hours of research on forums, reviews, in store investigations, this is what I bought. RANCILIO SILVIA w/ COMPUTER TEMP (PID)The Silvia is a great machine and the most popular. It's in the ~$600 price range without a temp. control modification. The temperature control is an custom modification to control the temperature of the water. Without the temp. control, the boiler can fluctuate ~40 degrees. You typically need to spend $2000+ for temperature control in an espresso machine, but you can get the Sylvia for less than half of that .  You can also buy kits to do this yourself and there are a number of instructions on how to do this, just google Silvia PID.Now you'll need a grinderI thought I could get away without buying a grinder, but I was wrong, very wrong. You'll need a burr grinder that you can adjust to match your coffee beans. I'll explain this more in the next step, but trust me, don't skimp on the grinder or you'll never be happy with your results. Step 2: Pulling Shots. <PIC> So you've got the gear, let's get started.Turn your machine on and let it warm upThe better the machine, the longer it takes to warm up. Make sure the handle is attached to the unit while it's warming up. You want all the brass to be nice and warm. The Silvia takes about 20 minutes to warm up. Also remember to make sure there is some water in the steam wand by turning it on and letting water run through it. You don't want heating components to be dry as they will get damaged over time. The Silvia can make hot water using the steam wand, so you just turn on the middle switch to run a little water through it. I also use the hot water to heat up my mugs before pulling the shots.Load up your espresso handle with coffeeLevel off any excess coffee before we get to tamping. Here's another item you'll need, a nice tamper. This is what you use to compress the coffee in the espresso handle basket. The Silvia uses a 58mm size tamper. When tamping, use about 30lbs of pressure. If you need a sense of how much pressure that is, try using a bathroom scale and pushing against it. Tap the sides to get any air bubbles out and then finish with a light twisting off motion.Insert espresso handle and start pullingMake sure the handle is properly locked into your machine before hitting any buttons. This is the area you'll need to work on the most. It is supposed to take around 25-30 seconds to pull one ounce of espresso from start to finish. If it comes out too fast, you need a finer grind. If it's too slow, you may need a coarser grind or you may be tamping too hard. If you don't have a good coffee grinder, you may not be able to get the right grind for your machine. Different types of coffees will need different grind settings.Before pulling, you also want to know the temperature of the water. Again, some coffees do better with different temperatures and even 1-2 degrees can make a difference. I'm using 219 degrees right now. You'll just need to experiment and if your machine does not have a temperature control, you can probably find somebody who has 'temp. surfed' it enough to know how to get the appropriate temp. With the Sylvia, you can run the espresso switch, water will come out, way about minute and it will be around 200 degrees. My advice, get a PID unit. Step 3: Milk Frothing. <PIC> If you like cappuccinos and lattes, spend the money and get a quality espresso machine or you won't be satisfied. The Silvia has great steam power and the power to make microfoam. Microfoam just means that the foam has tiny bubbles and it gives it a smooth texture. The only coffee shop that I know of that does microfoam really well, is Peet's coffee.Frothing basicsStart by putting your stainless steel frothing pitcher in the freezer. The colder your milk, the longer you can work with it to get nice foam. Don't use a pitcher larger than 20oz. and don't fill it more than half way. Bleed the steam wand of any water by turning it on and letting the water go out until all you have is steam. Place the pitcher of milk at a slight angle and insert the wand just under the surface. When you turn the steam on, turn it on until you stop hearing any really loud whining. The surf the tip just at the top of the milk. You want to get some air into the milk without creating large bubbles. You can hear the air getting sucked in as you do it. If there are huge bubbles, lower the tip into the milk.When the temperature is at 100 degrees sink the tip into milk and get it swirling. This creates finer bubbles with the air that you already got into the milk and is the path to microfoam. Microfoam is not easy and has a lot of subtleties that you'll need to work out by trial and error. I have just ordered a thicker gauge frothing pitcher to try out. I'll follow up if it helps.Clean the steam wand!After you are done frothing, wipe the wand with a wet rag or sponge. If you leave the milk on there, it's a real pain to get off later.Here's a short video to help with the sound and tip placement.", "images_list": ["../RECIPE/espresso-coffee_0.jpg", "../RECIPE/espresso-coffee_1.jpg", "../RECIPE/espresso-coffee_2.jpg", "../RECIPE/espresso-coffee_3.jpg"], "ref_chunks": ["41389_1", "41389_2", "41389_3", "41389_4"], "image_find_chunks": ["41389_3", "41389_2", "41389_1"], "query_find_chunks": ["41389_1", "41389_4", "40032_1"], "image_find_scores": [0.3317713141441345, 0.2870432138442993, 0.28302597999572754], "query_find_scores": [0.7076840400695801, 0.6513030529022217, 0.6079584360122681]}

{"question_id": "RECIPE_2278", "dataset": "RECIPE", "type": "test", "question": "What is the process for creating delightful organic seaweedless sushi using homegrown nasturtium leaves?", "answer": "Introduction: Organic Seaweedless Sushi - Growing Your Own Sushi Wraps From Edible, Easy-to-cultivate Leaves.. <PIC> FOREWORDIf like us, you are worried about marine pollution, then you will be looking to make your sushi wraps from something you can grow yourself. The following is one of the easiest and tastiest  I have found.Nasturtium tropaeolum majus is a most useful plant to grow in any garden not just for decoration or wildlife habitat but because the leaves, flowers and seeds are all edible. They will also  grow in poor soil, in containers and as they can be found in both bush  and climbing varieties, are eminently suitable for urban or limited  space, square foot and vertical gardening.Here I am using them as an alternative to nori and making home-grown sushi wraps.TOP PHOTOGRAPHFor a more elaborate traditional sushi, I wrap the rice in extra large  nasturtium leaves. I don't have a rolling mat but just use eco baking  paper. I can then cut them into lengths just as I would with nori. You  can also use other leafy vegetables such as cabbage, kale or spinach but  the younger and more pliable leaves are easier to manage.SECOND AND THIRD PHOTOGRAPHSmörgåsbord - open sandwich style sushi. A very simple light lunch, created from balls of Thai rice just placed on nasturtium leaf wraps. I  married them with a confits de tomates and a fines herbes omelette. Just fold the leaf around the rice ball as you pick it up and bite into a taste sensation. Step 1: TIPS ON GROWING THIS MEDICAL AND CULINARY PLANT. <PIC> COMMON GARDEN NASTURTIUMS -  MEDICAL AND CULINARY TREASURE YET SO EASY TO GROWNative to South America, in the past nasturtiums along with sprouted seeds and citrus fruit were used to treat scurvy because of  their high  vitamin C content, they also contain valuable anti-oxidants.  Prized for  many centuries as a medicinal plant, the nasturtium can be used to   treat skin problems (in particular acne), hair loss, respiratory and  urinary infections. So there is a lot more to this common garden plant  than meets the eye! You can grow nasturtiums all year round in just about any soil and although they are often described as annuals they are in fact perennial, so if you are careful to place them near a stone wall or other heat sink, then you can keep them going through the Winter. Nevertheless, they do self-seed very freely so you can actually do as I do and let them continue in the container, just adding a little new home-made organic compost once a year or whenever you see the leaves beginning to lose their healthy green colour.The only pest problem they really seem to have here is attack by cabbage white butterfly caterpillars, who find them just as tasty as we do. They are however easy to pick off the leaves and as my quail love to eat them, are yet another bonus of growing nasturtiums.HAVE FUN!Just have fun experimenting with colour and their fabulous peppery taste will make you want to use them with all your favourite fillings. If you can try to get hold of some of the seeds of nasturtium Jewel of Africa - find them on seed swaps or you can buy them through good seed merchants, I get mine from Chiltern seeds, for example on-line. The leaves are most beautifully variegated and they make fabulous sushi wrapsPlease  feel free to ask questions or share your own ideas either here, or on  the article, or any other questions you may have about growing and  eating nasturtiums.The original article of mine can be found :hereAll the very best and Bon Appétit!Pavlovafowl aka Sue", "images_list": ["../RECIPE/organic-seaweedless-sushi-making-your-own-home-gro_0.jpg", "../RECIPE/organic-seaweedless-sushi-making-your-own-home-gro_1.jpg"], "ref_chunks": ["41470_1", "41470_2"], "image_find_chunks": ["41470_1", "41470_2", "40338_1"], "query_find_chunks": ["41470_1", "41470_2", "40571_1"], "image_find_scores": [0.3191196620464325, 0.26781535148620605, 0.2641366422176361], "query_find_scores": [0.7429276704788208, 0.6611741781234741, 0.5354248285293579]}

{"question_id": "RECIPE_2294", "dataset": "RECIPE", "type": "test", "question": "What’s the best way to prepare a delicious chicken sinigang that highlights its signature sour flavor?", "answer": "Introduction: Chicken Sinigang. <PIC> \n          A pretty popular Filipino soup, Sinigang is a sour, savory soup that can be made with beef, pork, chicken, or fish. I use chicken in my soup because I like the lemon-chicken flavor combo. If you were to try fish, I would recommend a white fish over a salmon. I steer away from using red meat in this soup because I don't immediately associate beef or pork with something very tart and sour.\nThis recipe, like so many of the ones I use, is flexible. I build my recipes mainly on feel, taste patterns, and smell. If things smell 'right' together, I use them together. That's how I decide on vegetables and spices. Sometimes I ask my mom what she puts in each recipe, and then if I know I can't get a certain item, I ask what my substitute options are.\nHere's what I've settled on my must-haves for Sinigang:\n\n\t\t1 pouch Tamarind Soup Base (Knorr brand), in 8 cups of water\n\t\tChicken breasts and thighs, cut into bite-sizes (you can use as much as can fit in your soup pot)\n\t\tDaikon Radish slices\n\t\tBaby Spinach\n\t\tAsian Green Beans (the long, thing kind if I can find it)\n\t\t1/2 or 1/4 White Onion (if I have it)\n\t\tLemon juice, and Lemon Pepper if I'm feeling spicy!\nThere's an order to putting the ingredients into the pot, just because things take a little longer to cook. First, you stir the Soup Base powder into the water, and set the stove to a high temperature. Next, add your sliced daikon radish, and green beans. I make sure to wash and peel my daikon before slicing, and snap my green beans into bite size pieces. I try to use chinese long green beans, but I can only get my hands on french green beans sometimes. The green beans make the soup smell a little awkward, my roommates say it smells like farts. Oh well!\nThen, you add your lemon juice and lemon pepper. Half a lemon squeezed into the soup works just fine. Next, chop up the onion and toss it on in. Let the soup get to a boil for about 5-10 minutes, chop up the chicken while you wait, and add the chicken when the daikon slices start to turn a little transparent. The very last thing you add is the spinach, so it doesn't overcook. Wait until the chicken is finished cooking in the broth, and then toss in several handfuls of spinach. Let those simmer for a minute or two, keep stirring, and then you are ready to serve!\nIf you have steamed Jasmine Rice, make some! I love to add a spoonful or two of rice to the bottom of my bowl before dishing up the Sinigang. It's just the way I always ate it growing up.

{"question_id": "RECIPE_2235", "dataset": "RECIPE", "type": "test", "question": "What is the overall process for creating a delightful pumpkin spice cake with layers and frosting?", "answer": "Introduction: How to Make Pumpkin Spice Cake With Layers and Frosting and Everything!. <PIC> So, you would like to make dessert for the harvest season, but pumpkin pie seems so passe.  Well, give pumpkin cake a try.  This spiced treat includes a sweet caramel and cream cheese frosting that will knock your socks off - assuming you wear them.  I have adapted the recipe from Bon Apetit (you will notice the magazine in some of the pix), mostly because I just can't do exactly as told.  Ever.  My advice for those of you inspired by this Instructable is to follow the basic instructions and not to copy my actions - unless you like to take the long way.Always make sure you have ingredients and hardware on hand BEFORE starting the project.  Just this once, I was prepared and did not have to run out midway - thanks to my previous pumpkin torte success/debacle, I had already purchased heavy whipping cream.The Hardware2 9\" round cake pansbig mixing bowl - or three, if you don't want to wash between steps2 smaller bowlsA marvelous electric mixer - if not, then a sturdy spoon, lots of patience, and serious biceps.a long serrated knifea rubber spatulaa wide dull knife (aka frosting spatula)The Cake Ingredients3 cups all purpose flour2 teaspoons baking soda2 teaspoons baking powder1 15 oz. can pumpkin pie filling***1/2 cup sugar1 1/4 cup vegetable oil4 large eggsThe Frosting Ingredients1 1# box powdered sugar1/2 cup + 1Tbsp heavy whipping cream1 tsp vanilla extract1 8oz. package cream cheese, room temperature1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature***The original recipe called for pure pumpkin , 1 1/2 cup sugar, and a host of spices.   To save time, I hacked it and used Libby's pie filling, decreasing sugar.  It worked. Step 1: The Cake Batter. <PIC> First, we assemble the cake.  Preheat the oven to 350.  Make sure the racks are centered - too high or too low and your cake will burn, baby, burn.  Butter and flour the two cake pans, tapping out excess flour.  This will enable your cakes to pop out nicely when done.  I didn't actually have to do this because I have special nifty pans with arms that cut and relaease the bottoms.  However, in the interest of instruction, I have shown this step for those of you who probably don't have weird kitchen gadgetry.Whisk the first three ingredients in a large bowl.  Realize you want to use this bowl for the next step and transfer the flour mixture to one of the cake pans temporarily.  Alternately, start out using an extra bowl.  Sigh.  Using electric mixer (see note on previous step under \"Hardware\") beat pumpkin, sugar, and oil in large bowl.  I happen to have hazelnut oil, so I substituted about a 1/4 cup of it for some of the vegetable oil - should add a subtle flavor without changing the cake structure.  Feel free to experiment, just don't change the total amount of oil.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating to incorporate between additions.  Here the recipe called for 2 tsps of orange peel.  Bleah.  I skipped that and added some lemon peel instead.  Your cat will be supervising, so make sure no fur gets in the food.  Ugh.   Add flour mixture and beat on low speed just enough to blend it.  You want a light cake and beating the devil out of it will increase gluten production making for a more, ah, tough chewy cake.  Can we say, \"gross\"?  Now that the batter is ready, divide it equally into the prefloured and now empty cake pans.Bake the batter until a toothpick inserted comes out clean - 35 minutes in my oven.  Cool the cakes in pans for 10 minutes or so, then flip them out (nice to have a cooling rack for this) and turn them top side up to cool completely.During the cooking time, you may realize the can of pumpkin filling you purchased was overly large.  Since you have excess, you should utilize it by attempting the pumpkin torte again.  Hey!  By the time the cakes are done, you can toss it into the oven preheated to the same cooking temperature.  What else to do on a rainy day but bake?  Certainly not going to vaccuum... Step 2: The Frosting. <PIC> Cake is good, yes, but cake with frosting is better.  So make some frosting.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup powdered sugar over the bottom of a small skillet, cooking on medium heat until sugar melts. No need to stir yet, but I'm serious about the medium heat.  Don't burn the sugar with impatience.  Once melted, you can stir as needed, watching for a color change to amber - a coupla minutes.  Now, stir in 1/2 cup cream, vanilla, and salt.  (Useful to already have this mess mixed and ready to pour).  The goo is going to bubble like a witches cauldron.  Whee!  Stir some more, dissolving any hard bits.  Stir in that last teaspoon of cream, and let cool to room temperature in a small bowl.  You have just made candy.On to the next.  Using the electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter in a large bowl.  Gradually beat in powdered sugar.  How much?  Well....I went off the recipe because I started with a big container of powdered sugar instead of a 1# box.  Guesstimating as I mixed, I just kept adding sugar until the frosting attained a frostinglike stiffness.  Realizing I would be adding soupy caramel, I aimed for extra stiffness.  Then I began beating in the cooled caramel.  This is where you can really go to town with an electric mixer.  Whip it!Time to put completed frosting into a small bowl, cover it and chill it until spreadable.  Coupla hours.  One of the pix is finished frosting - the leftovers, that is.  It'll be used to make sandwiches out of  the cake tops that get cut off in the following step.  Waste nothing.              Step 3: Assemble the Layers. <PIC> In order for your cake to have a uniform appearance, the layers need to be even.  Cut the rounded tops off carefully using a loooong serrated knife.  Be careful. I don't think anyone has posted an Instructable for reattaching lost fingers.  Perhaps my next burning question?Place 1st  cake layer on a plate, cut side up.  Spread about a 1/4 of the frosting on the top.  Begin with a big glop in the center and gently work your way out using a frosting spatula or a very wide dull knife.  Go all the way to the edge, maybe a little over.  Trip over the dogs(large) on the way to grabbing the second cake.  Curse and grab your toes, hopping up and down.  Place the 2nd cake, cut side down, over the frosted layer.  Frost the top first, and then the sides, smoothing to your satisfaction.  I added some dried cherries and cranberries for decoration - use your imagination and be inventive with presentation.Survey the enormous mound of dirty kitchenware with trepidation, and long for a dishwasher.  Question whether the end result is worth the effortBegin washing. Step 4: Transporting and Serving. <PIC> I was sharing my cake with friends, but not entertaining at home, so that cake had to travel.  No cake should sit out in the rain, and it was pouring.  I had a large Tupperware container but no lid (Did I see it out in the garage last week?).  The cake went in the container and was given a plastic bag topper.  Voila!

{"question_id": "RECIPE_2347", "dataset": "RECIPE", "type": "test", "question": "What’s the best way to prepare a delicious chicken adobo that captures its rich flavors?", "answer": "Introduction: How to Cook Scrumptious Chicken Adobo. <PIC> A dish that has been passed on from one culture to another, adobo can be considered a staple of many households all over the world. Although it’s been linked a great deal to Spanish cuisine, it’s more popularly known in the Philippines and they have quite a number of variations of the dish to reinforce this claim. Ask any Filipino what their favorite viand is and expect that a large share of them will answer adobo. It may be a simple concoction of meat cooked in soy sauce and vinegar but the wonders it can do to your palate can be quite fascinating.Ingredients:• chicken, cut up into serving pieces • minced garlic • minced onion • dried laurel leaves • cooking oil • soy sauce • vinegar • black pepperInstructions: 1. Heat a pan in medium fire. While waiting, mince the garlic and the onion. 2. When the pan is hot enough, drizzle it with a bit of cooking oil. When the oil heats up, sauté the garlic. When the garlic turns golden brown, toss in the onions. 3. Add the pieces of chicken and parboil them so that they absorb the flavors of the garlic and onion. 4. As the chicken simmers in the oil, add the laurel leaves. 5. Pour in the soy sauce and the vinegar. Adjust the amount depending on your desired taste. If you prefer your adobo to be salty, indulge on the soy sauce. But if you like it a little tangy, add a little more vinegar. 6. Once you’re satisfied with the taste, cover the pan and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes. This will allow the meat to soak up on the flavors. 7. Check if the meat is cooked by poking it with a fork. When it’s tender enough, it’s time to turn off the fire. 8. Before serving, enhance its flavor by sprinkling ground pepper on the dish. If you’re fairly new to cooking adobo, try out this basic method of whipping up this iconic dish.

This process is characterized as a neutral mutation mechanism where paralogs undergo a division of labor, resulting in each gene being able to perform only one of the two original functions that the ancestral gene was capable of. In contrast, neofunctionalization represents a different outcome, where one of the duplicated gene copies acquires an entirely new function.

{"question_id": "WIKI_313", "dataset": "WIKI", "type": "test", "question": "What limitations does immunogold labeling have that affect the visualization of targeted molecules in electron microscopy?", "answer": "Immunogold labeling has several inherent limitations that can influence the accuracy and reliability of visualizing targeted molecules in electron microscopy.<PIC> One significant limitation is that the gold particle typically resides around 15-30 nm away from the site to which the primary antibody is bound, which means that the precise location of the targeted molecule cannot be accurately calculated. Additionally, while gold particles can be manufactured with diameters as small as 1 nm, this creates another challenge, as such small sizes make the gold label difficult to distinguish from surrounding tissue structures. Furthermore, thin sections of samples are necessary for immunogold labeling, which can lead to misleading images—where a thin slice might not accurately represent the three-dimensional structure of cell components. For instance, a microtubule may appear as a 'spike' depending on the sectioning plane utilized. To mitigate these limitations, researchers can take serial sections and compile them into a three-dimensional image, although this adds complexity to the imaging process. Another limitation is related to sample embedding: antibodies and gold particles cannot penetrate the resin used to embed samples, restricting the visualization to only accessible molecules. Labeling prior to embedding may help reduce this negative impact.", "images_list": ["../WIKI/w_s1826.jpg"], "ref_chunks": ["30336_1"], "image_find_chunks": ["30336_1", "30456_1", "30200_1"], "query_find_chunks": ["30336_1", "30492_1", "30194_1"], "image_find_scores": [0.2413957715034485, 0.23589329421520233, 0.21142488718032837], "query_find_scores": [0.6959351301193237, 0.42494624853134155, 0.4060862958431244]}

He was commissioned into The Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment) in 1896, achieving the rank of captain in 1904. His military advancements continued as he became a major in 1915, a colonel in 1919, a major general in 1929, a lieutenant general in 1934, and ultimately a general in 1938. Hildyard saw active service during the Second Boer War (1899–1902), where he received the Queen's Medal with four clasps and the King's Medal with two clasps. His extensive experience included serving as Aide-de-camp to commanding officers in South Africa and roles at the War Office and Southern Command leading up to the First World War. During WWI, he was seven times mentioned in despatches and was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order, alongside other honors. These experiences were pivotal in shaping his reputation as a capable military leader, providing a strong foundation for his later appointment as Governor of Bermuda from 1936 to 1939.
